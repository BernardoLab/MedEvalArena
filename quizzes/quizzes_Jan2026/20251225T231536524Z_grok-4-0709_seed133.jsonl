MRI shows a new T2-hyperintense lesion at T10 with gadolinium enhancement. Despite high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone, symptoms worsen over 48 hours. CSF analysis reveals elevated IgG index and oligoclonal bands. What is the most appropriate next step in management?", "options": ["Initiate plasma exchange", "Administer rituximab", "Start fingolimod", "Perform lumbar puncture for repeat CSF analysis", "Switch to natalizumab"], "answer": "A", "answer_index": 0, "explanation": "Plasma exchange is the most appropriate next step for severe acute demyelinating attacks unresponsive to corticosteroids in multiple sclerosis, as it rapidly removes circulating autoantibodies and inflammatory mediators. Rituximab and natalizumab are disease-modifying therapies not indicated for acute management, while fingolimod is contraindicated in active inflammation; repeat CSF analysis is unnecessary with established diagnosis.", "generator_model": "grok-4-0709", "seed": 133, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "target_topic": "Neurology"}

She develops orthostatic hypotension during tilt table training, with blood pressure dropping from 120/80 mmHg supine to 85/50 mmHg at 60 degrees. Heart rate increases minimally. Autonomic testing shows absent sympathetic skin response below the lesion. What is the most effective pharmacologic intervention to facilitate upright tolerance?", "options": ["Midodrine", "Fludrocortisone", "Propranolol", "Clonidine", "Ephedrine"], "answer": "A", "answer_index": 0, "explanation": "Midodrine, an alpha-1 agonist, is the most effective for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension in spinal cord injury by promoting vasoconstriction without significant supine hypertension risk. Fludrocortisone causes fluid retention but risks edema; propranolol and clonidine may worsen hypotension, while ephedrine is less selective and has more side effects.", "generator_model": "grok-4-0709", "seed": 133, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "target_topic": "Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation"}

MRI reveals bilateral vestibular schwannomas and a spinal ependymoma. Genetic testing confirms NF2 mutation. She develops progressive bilateral facial weakness. What is the most appropriate targeted therapy to consider for tumor stabilization?", "options": ["Bevacizumab", "Everolimus", "Crizotinib", "Trametinib", "Sorafenib"], "answer": "A", "answer_index": 0, "explanation": "Bevacizumab, a VEGF inhibitor, is the most appropriate for NF2-associated schwannomas by reducing tumor vascularity and stabilizing growth, with evidence from clinical trials showing hearing preservation. Everolimus targets mTOR but lacks specificity for NF2; crizotinib, trametinib, and sorafenib are not indicated for this condition and target unrelated pathways.", "generator_model": "grok-4-0709", "seed": 133, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "target_topic": "Neurology"}

Electromyography shows denervation in the L2-L4 myotomes. Despite optimized glycemic control, he has persistent muscle atrophy.
