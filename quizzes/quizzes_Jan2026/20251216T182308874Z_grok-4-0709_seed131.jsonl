Imaging reveals a 6 cm cyst with internal septations and hemorrhage. Renal function is preserved, but he develops fever and leukocytosis. Blood cultures are negative, but cyst aspiration yields purulent fluid positive for Escherichia coli. Despite appropriate intravenous antibiotics, his symptoms persist.
