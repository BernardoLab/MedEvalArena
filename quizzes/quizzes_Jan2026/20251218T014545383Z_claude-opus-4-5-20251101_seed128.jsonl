Current evidence and expert consensus support combination rituximab and cyclophosphamide as second-line therapy for refractory cases, as this combination targets both B-cell mediated antibody production and provides broader immunosuppression. Using either agent alone is less effective in severe refractory cases. Continuing first-line therapy alone when there is no response at 6 weeks delays effective treatment.

The risk of stent thrombosis from discontinuing antiplatelet therapy within 12 months of drug-eluting stent placement significantly outweighs the minimal bleeding risk associated with ECT. ECT does not involve surgical incisions, and intracranial hemorrhage during ECT is exceedingly rare even on anticoagulation. Discontinuing or bridging antiplatelet therapy is not recommended.
