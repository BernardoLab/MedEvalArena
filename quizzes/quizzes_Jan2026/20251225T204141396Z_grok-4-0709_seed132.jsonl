Examination reveals spastic paraparesis, upbeat nystagmus, and a positive Romberg sign. MRI shows T2 hyperintensities in the cerebellar peduncles and periventricular white matter. CSF analysis is normal except for elevated IgG index. What is the most likely diagnosis?", "options": ["Primary progressive multiple sclerosis", "Susac syndrome", "Behçet disease", "Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder", "Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis"], "answer": "B", "answer_index": 1, "explanation": "Susac syndrome is characterized by the triad of encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusions, and sensorineural hearing loss, but can present with cerebellar involvement and white matter lesions mimicking multiple sclerosis. Primary progressive multiple sclerosis typically lacks the specific upbeat nystagmus and vertigo seen here, while Behçet disease often includes oral ulcers and uveitis, which are absent. Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder usually features optic neuritis or transverse myelitis with aquaporin-4 antibodies, not present in this case.", "generator_model": "grok-4-0709", "seed": 132, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "target_topic": "Neurology"}

Biopsy shows subepidermal clefting with eosinophils and flame figures. Direct immunofluorescence is negative. What is the most appropriate next step in management?", "options": ["Switch to dupilumab", "Initiate dapsone therapy", "Administer rituximab", "Prescribe high-dose systemic corticosteroids", "Perform patch testing for contact allergens"], "answer": "B", "answer_index": 1, "explanation": "This presentation suggests bullous pemphigoid-like eruption induced by biologic therapy, but the flame figures and eosinophilic spongiosis point to eosinophilic cellulitis (Wells syndrome), which responds well to dapsone. Switching to dupilumab might exacerbate atopic conditions without addressing the eosinophilic component, while rituximab is reserved for refractory autoimmune bullous diseases. Systemic corticosteroids could provide temporary relief but are not first-line for this entity.", "generator_model": "grok-4-0709", "seed": 132, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "target_topic": "Dermatology"}

After 3 months, he develops shoulder pain and limited abduction. Imaging reveals heterotopic ossification around the glenohumeral joint. What is the most effective intervention to preserve joint mobility?", "options": ["Bisphosphonate therapy", "Low-dose radiation", "Surgical excision", "Indomethacin prophylaxis", "Passive range-of-motion exercises"], "answer": "B", "answer_index": 1, "explanation": "Low-dose radiation therapy is highly effective in preventing maturation of heterotopic ossification in spinal cord injury patients, preserving joint function without systemic side effects. Bisphosphonates like etidronate can inhibit mineralization but are less targeted and may cause gastrointestinal issues. Surgical excision is considered only after ossification matures and if function is severely impaired, not as a primary intervention.", "generator_model": "grok-4-0709", "seed": 132, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "target_topic": "Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation"}

CT angiography shows occlusion of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery with extension into the basilar artery. Despite thrombolysis, she deteriorates with locked-in syndrome.

Reperfusion injury typically manifests as hemorrhage, not progression of ischemia, while basilar artery dissection would show characteristic imaging findings not described.
