He has a history of Marfan syndrome. Vital signs: BP 180/110 mmHg in right arm, 100/60 mmHg in left arm, HR 120 bpm, SpO2 98% on room air. ECG shows sinus tachycardia. Portable CXR shows a widened mediastinum. Bedside transthoracic echocardiogram shows normal left ventricular function, no pericardial effusion, and a normal aortic root at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva. What is the most appropriate immediate management step?", "options": ["A. Administer IV labetalol to target systolic BP <120 mmHg", "B. Obtain an emergent CT angiogram of the chest/abdomen/pelvis", "C. Start an IV esmolol infusion to target heart rate <60 bpm and systolic BP <120 mmHg", "D. Administer IV morphine for pain control and arrange transfer to the operating room", "E. Perform transesophageal echocardiography in the ED to better visualize the aortic arch"], "answer": "C", "answer_index": 2, "explanation": "In acute aortic dissection (strongly suggested by pain, pulse deficit, and mediastinal widening), the priority is to reduce shear stress via heart rate and blood pressure control before definitive imaging. Esmolol is the preferred agent as it is a short-acting beta-blocker; pure vasodilators like nitroprusside can increase shear stress if used without beta-blockade. While CT angiography (B) is the definitive diagnostic test, controlling hemodynamics first minimizes the risk of extension or rupture during the scan. Labetalol (A) is appropriate but the specified target is too aggressive initially; a systolic BP of 100-120 mmHg is the goal. Direct transfer (D) or TEE (E) without hemodynamic control is dangerous.", "generator_model": "deepseek-v3.2", "seed": 134, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "target_topic": "Emergency Medicine"}

The clinical triad (confusion, ataxia, incontinence) and MRI findings of corpus callosum involvement are characteristic. PML (A) typically shows asymmetric, multifocal white matter lesions, often in immunocompromised hosts.

The key is recognizing that patients with alcohol withdrawal psychosis are often treated with antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol), which can trigger NMS. The fever, rigidity, and markedly elevated CK with myoglobinuria are classic. While delirium tremens (D) can cause fever and agitation, it does not typically cause severe rigidity.

The standard treatment for localized UTUC (especially in a solitary kidney or when contralateral kidney is normal) is radical nephroureterectomy with bladder cuff excision.
