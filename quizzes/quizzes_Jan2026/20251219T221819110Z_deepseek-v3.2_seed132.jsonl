He had group A streptococcal pharyngitis 6 weeks prior. Anti-streptolysin O titer is 800 IU/mL. MRI brain shows increased T2 signal in basal ganglia. Which of the following immunomodulatory therapies has demonstrated efficacy in controlled trials for pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS)?", "options": ["Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)", "Plasmapheresis", "Oral penicillin prophylaxis", "Intravenous methylprednisolone", "Rituximab"], "answer": "A", "answer_index": 0, "explanation": "While evidence for PANDAS treatments is limited, the randomized controlled trial by Perlmutter et al. (1999) in Lancet demonstrated that IVIG and plasmapheresis were superior to placebo for symptom reduction. IVIG is generally preferred first-line due to lower morbidity than plasmapheresis. Oral penicillin prevents new streptococcal infections but doesn't treat active neuropsychiatric symptoms. IV steroids have anecdotal support but no controlled trial evidence. Rituximab has case reports but no controlled trials. The question specifies proven efficacy in controlled trials, making IVIG (and plasmapheresis) correct, but IVIG is more commonly used as initial immunomodulation.", "generator_model": "deepseek-v3.2", "seed": 132, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "target_topic": "Psychiatry"}

Pathology shows pT2aN0 disease. Six months postoperatively, surveillance CT reveals a 2.5 cm enhancing mass at the left ureteroileal anastomosis. Cystoscopy confirms extrinsic compression. Biopsy shows recurrent urothelial carcinoma. Which of the following management approaches is most appropriate?", "options": ["Systemic chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin", "Radiation therapy to the anastomotic bed", "Surgical resection with revision of ureteroileal anastomosis", "Intravesical BCG instillation via conduit", "Enfortumab vedotin or sacituzumab govitecan"], "answer": "B", "answer_index": 1, "explanation": "Isolated local recurrence after radical cystectomy with negative margins is rare but potentially curable with radiation therapy. Surgical revision risks extensive adhesions and may not achieve clear margins. Systemic chemotherapy is indicated for metastatic disease but overtreats isolated local recurrence. Intravesical therapy cannot reach the ureteroileal anastomosis. Antibody-drug conjugates like enfortumab are for metastatic disease post-chemo and immunotherapy. Radiation with curative intent (60-66 Gy) offers chance of durable local control without morbidity of reoperation, particularly in medically inoperable patients or those with challenging surgical anatomy.", "generator_model": "deepseek-v3.2", "seed": 132, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "target_topic": "Urology"}

He undergoes emergent L3 laminectomy with tumor debulking and posterior instrumentation. Postoperatively, he is unable to void and has perianal anesthesia. MRI shows residual tumor compressing the thecal sac. He is started on dexamethasone and referred for radiation oncology consultation. Which of the following radiotherapy parameters is most critical for optimizing neurological recovery while minimizing toxicity?", "options": ["Total dose of 30 Gy in 10 fractions", "Treatment volume limited to involved vertebral body only", "Omitting simultaneous integrated boost to macroscopic disease", "Avoiding concurrent vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors", "Delaying radiotherapy until 4 weeks postoperatively"], "answer": "A", "answer_index": 0, "explanation": "For metastatic spinal cord compression with residual tumor post-decompression, 30 Gy in 10 fractions is the standard dose providing optimal balance of tumor control and spinal cord tolerance. Larger volumes including entire involved vertebra plus one above/below are needed to cover microscopic disease. Simultaneous boost increases cord toxicity risk. VEGF inhibitors can continue but with dose reduction if concurrent. Delaying radiation beyond 2 weeks increases recurrence risk; ideally start within 7-10 days postoperatively. The total dose-fractionation is most critical as single-fraction (8 Gy) provides less durable control, while higher doses (≥37.5 Gy) increase myelopathy risk without proven benefit.", "generator_model": "deepseek-v3.2", "seed": 132, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "target_topic": "Neurological Surgery"}

Biopsy confirms estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative adenocarcinoma of breast origin. She receives 30 Gy in 10 fractions to the sternum with good pain relief. Six months later, she develops new biopsy-proven breast cancer metastasis to the right humeral head within the previous radiation field. Which of the following factors most significantly increases the risk of radiation-associated second primary malignancy in this patient?", "options": ["Total radiation dose exceeding 30 Gy", "Concurrent hormonal therapy with aromatase inhibitor", "BRCA2 germline mutation", "Age >50 at time of irradiation", "Use of 3D-conformal rather than intensity-modulated radiotherapy"], "answer": "C", "answer_index": 2, "explanation": "BRCA2 mutations confer deficiency in homologous recombination DNA repair, dramatically increasing sensitivity to ionizing radiation and risk of radiation-induced second malignancies. Dose, technique, and age are minor factors compared to genetic predisposition. Concurrent aromatase inhibitors don't significantly increase radiation carcinogenesis. IMRT may increase low-dose bath but not necessarily secondary malignancy risk. The recurrence in-field is likely a recurrence rather than a radiation-induced second primary, but the question asks specifically about radiation-associated malignancy risk. BRCA2 carriers have 3-5 fold increased risk of radiation-induced cancers compared to non-carriers, mandating careful risk-benefit assessment for radiotherapy.", "generator_model": "deepseek-v3.2", "seed": 132, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "target_topic": "Radiation Oncology"}
