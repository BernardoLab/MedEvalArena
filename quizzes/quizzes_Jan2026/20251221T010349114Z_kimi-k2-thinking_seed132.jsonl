She has recurrent nocturnal falls, CKD stage 3b (eGFR 35 mL/min), and cognitive fluctuations. Current medications include levodopa/carbidopa, donepezil, and amlodipine 5 mg daily. Which is the most appropriate next step in management?", "options": ["Discontinue amlodipine and initiate midodrine 10 mg three times daily, with last dose before 6 PM", "Discontinue amlodipine and avoid all antihypertensive therapy given fall risk", "Switch amlodipine to short-acting captopril 12.5 mg at bedtime only", "Add fludrocortisone 0.1 mg daily and continue amlodipine, elevating head of bed 30°", "Initiate droxidopa 100 mg three times daily and discontinue amlodipine"], "answer": "C", "answer_index": 2, "explanation": "Consensus guidelines for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension recommend treating supine hypertension >180 mmHg with short-acting agents at bedtime to avoid exacerbating orthostatic symptoms. Captopril's 2-hour half-life is ideal for this purpose. Midodrine (A) worsens supine hypertension. Avoiding all treatment (B) risks end-organ damage from severe nocturnal hypertension. Fludrocortisone (D) exacerbates supine hypertension. Droxidopa (E) is not first-line and offers no advantage over midodrine in this scenario.", "generator_model": "kimi-k2-thinking", "seed": 132, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "target_topic": "Geriatrics"}

Grip strength is 14 kg, gait speed 0.75 m/s, and she refuses DXA. Bioelectrical impedance analysis shows SMI 6.8 kg/m² and phase angle 4.2°. According to the 2019 Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) diagnostic algorithm, what is the most appropriate classification?", "options": ["Severe sarcopenia", "Confirmed sarcopenia", "Probable sarcopenia", "Pre-sarcopenia", "Normal muscle status"], "answer": "B", "answer_index": 1, "explanation": "AWGS 2019 defines confirmed sarcopenia as low muscle strength (<18 kg for women) plus either low muscle mass or low physical performance (gait speed <0.8 m/s). This patient meets criteria for low strength and low performance despite normal SMI (>5.7 kg/m² by BIA). Phase angle is not a primary diagnostic criterion. Severe sarcopenia (A) requires all three criteria. Probable sarcopenia (C) is strength-only.
