On postoperative day 3, his closed-suction drain has serous output of 25 mL/24 hours. Drain fluid amylase is 1,200 U/L (serum amylase 150 U/L). He is afebrile, hemodynamically stable, with soft abdomen and no leukocytosis.

Grade B fistula requires output >30 mL/day or clinical impact. The high amylase alone does not mandate retention if output remains low and the patient is clinically well.", "generator_model": "kimi-k2-thinking", "seed": 133, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "target_topic": "General Surgery"}
