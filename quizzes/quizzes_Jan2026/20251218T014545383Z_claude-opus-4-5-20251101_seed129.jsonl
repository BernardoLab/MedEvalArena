MRI reveals a 1.8 cm intradural intramedullary lesion at T8 with homogeneous enhancement and associated syrinx extending from T6 to T10. The lesion has well-defined margins and appears to have a cleavage plane from the spinal cord. Intraoperatively, after myelotomy, a grayish-tan tumor is encountered that appears to have a clear plane from the surrounding cord. Frozen section suggests ependymoma. Which surgical strategy is MOST appropriate?", "options": ["Gross total resection with ultrasonic aspiration of tumor margins", "Gross total resection with en bloc removal maintaining tumor capsule integrity", "Subtotal resection followed by adjuvant radiation therapy", "Biopsy only with planned stereotactic radiosurgery", "Gross total resection with intraoperative radiation to tumor bed"], "answer": "B", "answer_index": 1, "explanation": "Spinal cord ependymomas are typically well-circumscribed tumors with a clear cleavage plane from surrounding neural tissue, making gross total resection (GTR) the treatment of choice with excellent long-term outcomes (>90% 10-year PFS with GTR). En bloc removal maintaining capsule integrity is preferred over piecemeal resection to minimize cord manipulation and reduce recurrence risk from residual tumor cells. Ultrasonic aspiration at margins risks thermal injury to the cord and tumor spillage. Subtotal resection with radiation has inferior outcomes to GTR alone. The presence of a clear plane and characteristic appearance strongly supports attempting complete resection.", "generator_model": "claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "seed": 129, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "target_topic": "Neurological Surgery"}

Modern IMRT planning prioritizes constrictor sparing when oncologically feasible.
