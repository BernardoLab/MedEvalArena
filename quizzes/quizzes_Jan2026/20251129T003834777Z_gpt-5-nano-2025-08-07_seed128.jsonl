He is started on unfractionated heparin infusion. On hospital day 5, his platelets drop from 210,000/µL to 60,000/µL, with new thrombosis at a line site and no other clear cause. He has no prior exposure to heparin recently. Which is the best next step in management?", "options": ["A) Continue heparin at a reduced rate and transfuse platelets if platelets fall below 40,000/µL", "B) Immediately discontinue all forms of heparin and initiate a non-heparin anticoagulant such as argatroban; order PF4-heparin antibody testing", "C) Stop heparin and start warfarin with bridging after platelet recovery", "D) Administer protamine sulfate to reverse heparin and resume unfractionated heparin", "E) Withhold anticoagulation for 24 hours and observe"], "answer": "B", "answer_index": 1, "explanation": "This clinical picture is classic for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Discontinue heparin immediately and start a non-heparin anticoagulant (eg, argatroban; anticoagulation is still required due to thrombosis risk). PF4-heparin antibody testing can confirm HIT, but treatment should not be delayed for serology. Warfarin is avoided acutely and should be started only after platelets recover; platelet transfusions are generally reserved for life-threatening bleeding.", "generator_model": "gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07", "seed": 128, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true}
