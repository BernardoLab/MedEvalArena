Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?", "options": ["Proceed directly to liver transplantation without biopsy confirmation given high suspicion for cholangiocarcinoma in PSC", "Perform endoscopic ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration of the hilar mass", "Initiate neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by liver transplantation per Mayo Clinic protocol", "Repeat ERCP with cholangioscopy and targeted biopsies of the suspicious area", "Treat as benign dominant stricture with serial stenting and repeat CA 19-9 in 3 months"], "answer": "C", "answer_index": 2, "explanation": "In patients with PSC and suspected hilar cholangiocarcinoma, the Mayo Clinic protocol for neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by liver transplantation requires strict diagnostic criteria including biopsy confirmation or strongly suggestive findings (CA 19-9 >100 U/mL, malignant-appearing stricture on imaging). PET SUV >5.0 with suspicious cytology meets criteria for protocol enrollment. Direct transplantation without protocol adherence risks transplanting unrecognized metastatic disease.

This autosomal dominant mutation affects approximately 3-4% of Japanese patients and requires switching to ravulizumab or other anti-C5 agents. Anti-drug antibodies are rare with eculizumab.
