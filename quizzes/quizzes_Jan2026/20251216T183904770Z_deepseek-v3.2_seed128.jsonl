During the infusion, she experiences dissociative symptoms but shows marked mood improvement. However, 48 hours later, she develops severe agitation, paranoid ideation, and visual hallucinations. MRI brain shows new, symmetric T2 hyperintensities in the splenium of the corpus callosum. Which specific pathogenetic mechanism explains this delayed neurological complication?", "options": ["Ketamine-induced excitotoxicity via NMDA receptor internalization", "Unmasking of underlying neurodegenerative disease", "Osmotic demyelination from rapid mood improvement", "Autoimmune encephalitis triggered by glutamatergic activation", "Cerebral hyperperfusion from nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation"], "answer": "A", "answer_index": 0, "explanation": "This describes delayed neurotoxicity from ketamine, possibly via downstream effects of NMDA receptor antagonism including compensatory glutamate surge and excitotoxicity. The splenial lesion is characteristic of transient lesion syndrome associated with various toxins and seizures. This differs from osmotic demyelination which affects pons more commonly. Autoimmune encephalitis would present differently. The timing suggests a metabolic/toxic mechanism rather than unmasking of underlying disease. Ketamine's effects on glutamate homeostasis can cause both therapeutic and adverse neurological effects.", "generator_model": "deepseek-v3.2", "seed": 128, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "target_topic": "Psychiatry"}
