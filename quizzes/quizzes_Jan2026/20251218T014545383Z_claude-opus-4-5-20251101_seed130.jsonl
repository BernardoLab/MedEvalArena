He is started on pembrolizumab. After 4 cycles, restaging shows mixed response with regression of most lesions but growth of a single hepatic metastasis. Biopsy of the progressing lesion reveals loss of β2-microglobulin expression. Which mechanism best explains resistance to pembrolizumab in this lesion?", "options": ["Upregulation of alternative immune checkpoints (LAG-3, TIM-3)", "Defective antigen presentation via MHC class I pathway", "Increased regulatory T-cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment", "Activation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway excluding T-cells", "Loss of tumor neoantigens through immunoediting"], "answer": "B", "answer_index": 1, "explanation": "β2-microglobulin (B2M) is essential for MHC class I complex assembly and surface expression. Loss of B2M results in absent MHC class I expression, preventing CD8+ T-cell recognition of tumor antigens regardless of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. This is a well-characterized mechanism of acquired resistance to checkpoint inhibitors. While alternative checkpoints, Tregs, WNT/β-catenin activation, and neoantigen loss can all contribute to immunotherapy resistance, the specific finding of B2M loss directly implicates defective MHC class I antigen presentation as the primary resistance mechanism in this lesion.", "generator_model": "claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "seed": 130, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "target_topic": "Medical Oncology"}

She has experienced three episodes of anaphylaxis in the past year, each occurring 2-4 hours after eating, with no consistent food trigger identified. Episodes are characterized by flushing, hypotension, and abdominal cramping. Baseline serum tryptase is 6 ng/mL (normal <11.4). Skin prick testing to common food allergens is negative. During her most recent episode, serum tryptase was 28 ng/mL. Bone marrow biopsy shows scattered atypical mast cells expressing CD25. KIT D816V mutation is detected. Which diagnostic criterion confirms systemic mastocytosis in this patient?", "options": ["Elevated acute tryptase level during anaphylaxis", "Presence of CD25-positive mast cells on bone marrow biopsy", "Detection of KIT D816V mutation", "Baseline tryptase level above 20 ng/mL", "Multifocal dense mast cell aggregates (>15 mast cells) in bone marrow"], "answer": "E", "answer_index": 4, "explanation": "Diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis requires either the major criterion (multifocal dense aggregates of ≥15 mast cells in bone marrow or extracutaneous tissue) OR three minor criteria. Minor criteria include: >25% spindle-shaped/atypical mast cells, KIT D816V mutation, CD25/CD2 expression on mast cells, and baseline tryptase >20 ng/mL. This patient has two minor criteria (CD25 expression and KIT mutation) but needs either the major criterion or one more minor criterion. Her baseline tryptase of 6 ng/mL does not meet the minor criterion threshold. Finding dense mast cell aggregates (major criterion) would definitively confirm the diagnosis.", "generator_model": "claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "seed": 130, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "target_topic": "Allergy/Immunology"}

More importantly, the 2023 focused update to HF guidelines recommends MRAs (spironolactone/eplerenone) as a Class IIa recommendation for HFpEF to reduce hospitalizations. While finerenone has shown benefits in diabetic kidney disease, its role in HFpEF is less established than traditional MRAs. Sacubitril/valsartan (PARAGON-HF) showed benefit primarily in women and those with EF at the lower end of the HFpEF spectrum.
