Final pathology shows a 3.8-cm encapsulated follicular-patterned lesion with capsular and focal vascular invasion in 2 of 8 intracapsular vessels, RAS-mutant, no extrathyroidal extension, and no lymph node involvement. According to modern risk stratification and evolving nomenclature, which postoperative management is most appropriate?", "options": ["Classify as noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP) and no further therapy", "Classify as minimally invasive follicular thyroid carcinoma and recommend routine radioactive iodine ablation", "Classify as encapsulated angioinvasive follicular variant papillary thyroid carcinoma and consider RAI only if postoperative thyroglobulin is detectable", "Classify as low-risk differentiated thyroid carcinoma managed with levothyroxine to keep TSH mildly suppressed and no routine RAI", "Classify as high-risk due to vascular invasion and treat with high-dose RAI and aggressive TSH suppression (<0.1 mIU/L)"], "answer": "D", "answer_index": 3, "explanation": "Encapsulated follicular-patterned tumors with limited vascular invasion (≤4 foci) and no extrathyroidal extension are considered low-risk differentiated thyroid carcinomas; current guidelines favor TSH suppression and no routine RAI, particularly in RAS-mutated lesions without nodal disease. NIFTP (A) requires no invasion; this lesion shows both capsular and vascular invasion. Routine RAI (B, E) is excessive for low-risk tumors. Labeling as high-risk (E) is not justified by limited angioinvasion alone. Option C misclassifies the entity and overemphasizes histologic subtype.", "generator_model": "gpt-5.1-2025-11-13", "seed": 130, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "target_topic": "Endocrine", "abms_specialty": "Endocrine", "abms_source": "target_topic", "source_label_raw": "Endocrine", "source_quiz_id": "20251223T225810101Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed130", "source_question_id": "20251223T225810101Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed130-016", "source_runs_root": "/home/dbernardo/Documents/pyres/MedEvalArena/eval_results/quizbench/quizzes_Jan2026/runs", "source_run_dir": "/home/dbernardo/Documents/pyres/MedEvalArena/eval_results/quizbench/quizzes_Jan2026/runs/gpt-5.1-2025-11-13/20251223T225810101Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed130", "source_quiz_path": "/home/dbernardo/Documents/pyres/MedEvalArena/quizzes/quizzes_Jan2026/20251223T225810101Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed130.jsonl"}
