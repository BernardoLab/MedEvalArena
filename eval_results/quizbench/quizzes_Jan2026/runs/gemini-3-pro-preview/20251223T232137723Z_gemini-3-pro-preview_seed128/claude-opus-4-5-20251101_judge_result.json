The vignette describes a 65-year-old male with intention tremor, gait ataxia, and MRI showing T2 hyperintensities in middle cerebellar peduncles (MCP sign)—classic features of FXTAS. The critical clue is the grandson with intellectual disability, suggesting the grandfather is a premutation carrier whose grandson inherited a full mutation (anticipation phenomenon in trinucleotide repeat disorders). Key discriminating findings: (1) late-onset cerebellar syndrome with MCP sign pathognomonic for FXTAS, (2) family history consistent with Fragile X premutation carrier status. Option B correctly identifies CGG repeat expansion 55-200 causing mRNA toxicity—the established pathomechanism of FXTAS. Option A describes full mutation Fragile X syndrome (>200 repeats, gene silencing), which presents with intellectual disability, not late-onset ataxia. Option C (CAG/polyglutamine) suggests spinocerebellar ataxias or Huntington's. Option D (CTG) suggests myotonic dystrophy. Option E (deletion) would not explain the phenotype or family pattern.
