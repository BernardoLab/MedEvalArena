Main logical issue(s): None; the vignette provides sufficient discriminating findings to identify MELAS and select IV arginine as the best acute management without contradictions or underspecification. Main medical accuracy issue(s): None; the presentation aligns with classic MELAS features (mitochondrial disorder causing metabolic stroke-like episodes, lactic acidosis), and IV arginine is evidence-based for acute treatment by enhancing nitric oxide and cerebral perfusion, consistent with current guidelines (e.g., mitochondrial medicine literature). The rationale correctly notes it's not thrombotic, contraindicating tPA or anticoagulants.\n\nBest-answer defensibility: a) The question asks for the indicated acute agent for suspected MELAS stroke-like episode. b) Discriminating findings: young age, SNHL, short stature (mitochondrial clues), non-vascular lesion, elevated lactate (lactic acidosis). c) Most likely: MELAS. d) Keyed B (IV Arginine) fits by addressing nitric oxide deficiency; assumes standard MELAS management. e) A: tPA for ischemic stroke, but not thrombotic here. C: Heparin for thrombosis, inappropriate. D: Aspirin antiplatelet, not metabolic. E: Plasma exchange for autoimmune, irrelevant.
