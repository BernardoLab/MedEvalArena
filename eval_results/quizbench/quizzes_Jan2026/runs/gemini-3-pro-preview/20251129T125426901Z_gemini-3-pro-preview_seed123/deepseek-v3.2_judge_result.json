Verdict: Miskeyed. The vignette describes a tool grinder with chronic dry cough/dyspnea and BAL showing 'cannibalistic' giant cells, which is pathognomonic for Hard Metal Lung Disease (GIP). The keyed answer is C (Cobalt), which is the correct causative agent for GIP. However, the stem is underspecified (U) because it does not mention the classic histologic finding of giant cells engulfing other cells is specific to GIP, and the link to tool grinding is a strong clue. The key is correct, but the logical failure is that the stem's description of 'cannibalistic' giant cells is so specific that it uniquely points to GIP/cobalt, making the key correct. The miskey label (K) is applied because the logical validity is false due to the key being correct, but the stem is underspecified for a learner not familiar with this esoteric fact. Minimal fix: Add 'Giant cell interstitial pneumonia (GIP) is seen on biopsy' to the stem to explicitly link the histology to the disease, then the key to cobalt is unambiguous.", "medical_accuracy_score": 5, "logical_validity": false, "logical_false_reason": "K", "verdict": "FAIL", "fail_reason": "K"}, "judge_verdict": "FAIL", "judge_fail_reason": "K", "judge_medical_accuracy_score": 5}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T125426901Z_gemini-3-pro-preview_seed123", "question_id": "20251129T125426901Z_gemini-3-pro-preview_seed123-010", "question": "A 52-year-old male presents to the ED 2 hours after ingesting a massive overdose of sustained-release Verapamil.
