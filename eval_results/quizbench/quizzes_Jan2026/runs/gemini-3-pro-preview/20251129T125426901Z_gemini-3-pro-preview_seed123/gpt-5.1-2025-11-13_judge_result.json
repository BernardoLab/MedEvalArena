This constellation is classic for MELAS with a stroke-like episode rather than an ischemic stroke due to large-vessel thrombosis.\n\nMost likely diagnosis/mechanism: MELAS-related stroke-like episode driven by mitochondrial metabolic failure and nitric oxide deficiency–related microvascular dysfunction, not embolic/thrombotic occlusion.\n\nKeyed answer (IV arginine) fits: current literature and expert consensus support IV arginine (and sometimes citrulline) acutely for MELAS stroke-like episodes to improve nitric oxide availability and cerebral perfusion. tPA is inappropriate because there is no focal vascular occlusion and could pose bleeding risk. Heparin and high-dose aspirin target thrombotic/embolic mechanisms, not metabolic stroke-like lesions. Plasma exchange is aimed at immune-mediated processes (e.g., TTP, GBS, NMDA encephalitis), not mitochondrial disease.\n\nMain medical accuracy issues: Minor—practice is based on limited evidence but is the best-supported acute intervention; explanation is broadly accurate.\n\nMinimal fix: Explicitly name MELAS in the stem or add a prior genetic/biopsy diagnosis to remove any residual ambiguity and solidify the teaching point.\n", "medical_accuracy_score": 4, "logical_validity": true, "logical_false_reason": "T", "verdict": "PASS", "fail_reason": "NA"}, "judge_verdict": "PASS", "judge_fail_reason": "NA", "judge_medical_accuracy_score": 4}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T125426901Z_gemini-3-pro-preview_seed123", "question_id": "20251129T125426901Z_gemini-3-pro-preview_seed123-008", "question": "A 32-year-old female is evaluated for palpitations.
