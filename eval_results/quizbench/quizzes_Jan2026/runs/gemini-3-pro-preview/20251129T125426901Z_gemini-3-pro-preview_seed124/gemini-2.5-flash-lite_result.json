The presence of a monoclonal protein (IgG lambda) and an elevated serum free light chain ratio (1.8) points towards light chain (AL) amyloidosis.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Initiate tafamidis therapy: Tafamidis is a medication used to treat transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR), not AL amyloidosis. Therefore, this is not the appropriate next step.\n\nB. Perform TTR genetic testing: This is relevant for diagnosing hereditary ATTR amyloidosis. Given the monoclonal protein, AL amyloidosis is more likely, making TTR genetic testing less of a priority for confirming the diagnosis of the underlying cause of amyloidosis in this specific context.\n\nC. Endomyocardial biopsy: While an endomyocardial biopsy can confirm amyloid deposition and differentiate between types, it is an invasive procedure. In cases with a high suspicion of AL amyloidosis based on clinical presentation, imaging, and laboratory findings, less invasive methods are often preferred for initial confirmation.\n\nD. Abdominal fat pad aspiration: This is a less invasive method to diagnose amyloidosis. Amyloid deposits can be found in subcutaneous fat, particularly in the abdominal wall. A positive biopsy from this site can confirm amyloid deposition and, when combined with the monoclonal protein, strongly supports the diagnosis of AL amyloidosis. This is a standard and appropriate next step in confirming AL amyloidosis.\n\nE. Initiate bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone: This is a treatment regimen for AL amyloidosis. Initiating treatment before confirming the diagnosis and staging the disease is premature.\n\nConsidering the options, an abdominal fat pad aspiration is the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis of amyloidosis in this patient with strong clinical and laboratory evidence suggestive of AL amyloidosis.\n\nThe answer is (D)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T125426901Z_gemini-3-pro-preview_seed124", "question_id": "20251129T125426901Z_gemini-3-pro-preview_seed124-002", "question": "A 24-year-old male presents with recurrent fevers, livedo racemosa, and acute left hemiparesis.

This is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the *CECR1* gene, which encodes ADA2. The clinical manifestations include vasculitis, stroke, livedo racemosa, fevers, and immunodeficiency. The \"beads-on-a-string\" appearance on angiography is characteristic of vasculopathy in DADA2. The low immunoglobulin levels are also consistent with immune dysregulation seen in this condition.\n\nLet's analyze the treatment options in the context of DADA2:\n\n*   **A. Cyclophosphamide:** This is an immunosuppressant that can be used in severe vasculitis, but it is not the primary or most appropriate maintenance therapy for DADA2. It carries significant side effects.\n\n*   **B. Rituximab:** This is a B-cell depleting antibody. While it can be used in some autoimmune conditions and vasculitis, it is not the standard of care for DADA2.\n\n*   **C. Etanercept:** This is a TNF-alpha inhibitor. TNF-alpha plays a role in inflammation, and while some patients with DADA2 might benefit from anti-TNF therapy, it is not the most established or universally effective maintenance therapy.\n\n*   **D. Prednisone monotherapy:** Corticosteroids like prednisone are often used to manage acute inflammatory flares in DADA2. However, they are generally not recommended as long-term monotherapy due to their significant side effects and the fact that they do not address the underlying genetic defect.\n\n*   **E. Plasma exchange:** Plasma exchange is a treatment that removes antibodies and other inflammatory mediators from the blood. It can be used for acute, severe manifestations of DADA2, such as stroke or severe vasculitis, to rapidly reduce inflammation. However, it is a supportive measure for acute crises and not a maintenance therapy.\n\nThe most appropriate maintenance therapy for DADA2, especially in patients with recurrent fevers, vasculitis, and neurological events, is **hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)**. HSCT can correct the underlying genetic defect and has shown significant success in preventing further disease manifestations. However, HSCT is a complex procedure and not always immediately available or indicated for all patients.\n\nGiven the options provided, and considering that the question asks for *maintenance therapy*, none of the options are ideal long-term maintenance therapies for DADA2. However, if we interpret \"maintenance therapy\" in the context of managing the underlying disease process and preventing recurrence, and considering the available options, we need to think about what might be used to control the vasculitis and immune dysregulation.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the options with the understanding that HSCT is the definitive treatment but not listed. In the absence of HSCT, management focuses on controlling inflammation and preventing complications.\n\n*   **Etanercept (C)**, a TNF-alpha inhibitor, has shown promise in some studies for managing the inflammatory and vasculitic manifestations of DADA2, particularly in patients who do not have access to HSCT or are awaiting it. It targets the inflammatory pathway implicated in the disease.\n\nWhile prednisone (D) is used for flares, it's not ideal for long-term maintenance. Cyclophosphamide (A) and Rituximab (B) are generally reserved for more severe or refractory cases of vasculitis and are not the first-line maintenance therapy for DADA2. Plasma exchange (E) is for acute management.\n\nTherefore, among the given choices, Etanercept is the most plausible option for maintenance therapy, as it addresses the inflammatory component of the disease and has some evidence supporting its use in DADA2.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$."}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T125426901Z_gemini-3-pro-preview_seed124", "question_id": "20251129T125426901Z_gemini-3-pro-preview_seed124-003", "question": "A 64-year-old male presents with a 1-year history of progressive gait instability, dysarthria, and dysphagia.

Anti-Hu antibodies are typically associated with paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis, often in the context of small cell lung cancer. While they can cause a range of neurological symptoms including cerebellar ataxia, encephalopathy, and autonomic dysfunction, the prominent sleep disturbances and acting out dreams are less characteristic.\n\nB. Anti-Ma2 antibodies are associated with limbic encephalitis, particularly in younger males, and often present with diencephalic and brainstem involvement, including sleep disturbances and behavioral changes. However, the progressive gait instability and dysphagia are not as consistently prominent as in this case.\n\nC. Anti-LGI1 antibodies are a common cause of autoimmune limbic encephalitis, often presenting with temporal lobe epilepsy, memory impairment, and psychiatric symptoms. While gait instability can occur, the severe sleep disturbances and acting out dreams are not typical primary features.\n\nD.

Let's analyze the options:\n\nA. Sarcoidosis: While sarcoidosis can cause fever, weight loss, fatigue, pancytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and granulomas, it typically doesn't have a direct association with prosthetic valves and the specific pattern of hypermetabolic activity in the spleen and bone marrow in this context is less characteristic.\n\nB. Culture-negative endocarditis (HACEK group): HACEK organisms are known causes of culture-negative endocarditis, which can present with fever, weight loss, and fatigue. However, the absence of vegetations on TTE and TEE makes this less likely. While prosthetic valve endocarditis can be difficult to diagnose, the lack of visible vegetations is a significant negative finding.\n\nC. Mycobacterium chimaera: This is a strong contender. Mycobacterium chimaera is a non-tuberculous mycobacterium that has been linked to late-onset prosthetic valve endocarditis, particularly following cardiac surgery involving heater-cooler units. Symptoms can include fever, weight loss, fatigue, and pancytopenia. The organism can disseminate to various organs, including the spleen and bone marrow, leading to hypermetabolic activity on PET-CT. Bone marrow biopsy showing non-caseating granulomas can be seen in mycobacterial infections, although caseating granulomas are more classic for tuberculosis. However, non-caseating granulomas can occur with other mycobacterial species. The negative standard blood cultures are also consistent, as mycobacteria can be difficult to culture.\n\nD. Tropheryma whipplei: Whipple's disease can cause fever, weight loss, fatigue, and pancytopenia. It can also affect the spleen and bone marrow. However, it typically involves the small intestine, leading to malabsorption, which is not mentioned here. While it can cause granulomas, the strong association with prosthetic valves and the specific presentation points away from this.\n\nE. Late-onset prosthetic valve thrombosis: Prosthetic valve thrombosis can cause symptoms like fever, fatigue, and weight loss, and can lead to valve dysfunction. However, it typically doesn't cause pancytopenia or granulomatous inflammation in the bone marrow. While thrombosis can occur, the other findings are not explained by this diagnosis.\n\nConsidering the patient's history of aortic valve replacement, the subacute presentation with fever, weight loss, fatigue, pancytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and the PET-CT findings of hypermetabolic activity in the spleen and bone marrow, Mycobacterium chimaera is the most fitting diagnosis.

This clinical picture is highly suggestive of a gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN), specifically a placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT) or a related entity, given the postpartum presentation and hPL positivity. While the beta-hCG is low, it is elevated above the normal postpartum level and indicates persistent trophoblastic activity.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Methotrexate and Folinic Acid: This is a common chemotherapy regimen for low-risk GTN, but it is typically used for choriocarcinoma or other forms of GTN with higher beta-hCG levels. Given the specific presentation and the possibility of a PSTT, this might not be the most effective first-line treatment.\n\nB. Actinomycin D: This is another chemotherapeutic agent used in GTN, often in combination regimens.\n\nC. EMA-CO regimen (Etoposide, Methotrexate, Actinomycin D, Cyclophosphamide, Vincristine): This is a multi-agent chemotherapy regimen used for high-risk GTN. While effective for GTN, the patient's beta-hCG is relatively low, and the mass is described as echogenic with hPL positivity, which can be characteristic of PSTT. PSTTs can be less responsive to standard chemotherapy than choriocarcinomas.\n\nD. Hysterectomy: Given the localized nature of the mass (4 cm echogenic mass in the myometrium) and the suspicion of a PSTT, which can be less responsive to chemotherapy and has a risk of local recurrence or spread, hysterectomy is often considered the treatment of choice, especially if the patient has completed childbearing. PSTTs are often treated surgically. If the patient desires future fertility, a fertility-sparing approach might be considered, but hysterectomy is generally the definitive treatment for localized PSTT. The negative staging workup for metastasis supports a localized disease approach.\n\nE. Pembrolizumab: This is an immunotherapy agent. While immunotherapy is being explored for various gynecologic cancers, it is not a standard first-line treatment for GTN, especially in this context.\n\nConsidering the diagnosis of a likely PSTT or a related GTN with a localized mass and relatively low beta-hCG, surgical management with hysterectomy is the most appropriate treatment of choice, especially if the patient has completed childbearing.

Isoproterenol (a beta-agonist) increases heart rate and calcium current, normalizing the ST segment and suppressing VF. Quinidine is the oral alternative.

Electrical storm, defined as three or more episodes of VT/VF within 24 hours requiring ICD intervention, is a life-threatening emergency.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Intravenous Amiodarone: Amiodarone is a Class III antiarrhythmic that prolongs the action potential duration and effective refractory period. It is often used in refractory ventricular arrhythmias, including those seen in Brugada syndrome. While it can be effective, it has a slower onset of action compared to some other agents and can have significant side effects.\n\nB. Intravenous Lidocaine: Lidocaine is a Class Ib antiarrhythmic that blocks sodium channels, primarily in their inactivated state. It is effective against ventricular arrhythmias, particularly those originating from the ventricles. It has a rapid onset of action and is often a first-line agent for acute ventricular arrhythmias.\n\nC. Intravenous Isoproterenol: Isoproterenol is a non-selective beta-adrenergic agonist. While beta-blockers are generally used to *prevent* arrhythmias in Brugada syndrome, isoproterenol (a beta-agonist) would likely *exacerbate* the arrhythmogenic substrate by increasing heart rate and contractility, potentially worsening the situation. It is not indicated for acute suppression of VF.\n\nD. Intravenous Procainamide: Procainamide is a Class Ia antiarrhythmic that blocks sodium channels and prolongs repolarization. It can be effective for ventricular arrhythmias, but it can also prolong the QT interval, which could be problematic in certain arrhythmogenic conditions. In Brugada syndrome, sodium channel blockers are generally avoided due to the risk of worsening the characteristic ECG changes and potentially increasing arrhythmia risk.\n\nE. Intravenous Metoprolol: Metoprolol is a beta-blocker (Class II antiarrhythmic). Beta-blockers are often used as long-term therapy to reduce the risk of arrhythmias in Brugada syndrome. However, in the acute setting of electrical storm, while they can be part of management, they are not typically the first-line agent for immediate suppression of ongoing VF. Their effect is more prophylactic.\n\nConsidering the acute, life-threatening nature of electrical storm due to VF in Brugada syndrome, a rapid-acting antiarrhythmic is needed. Lidocaine is a well-established first-line agent for the acute management of ventricular fibrillation and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, especially when amiodarone is not immediately available or has not yet taken effect. While amiodarone is also a consideration, lidocaine often has a quicker onset of action in the acute setting. Procainamide is generally contraindicated or used with extreme caution in Brugada syndrome. Isoproterenol would be detrimental. Metoprolol is more for long-term prevention.\n\nTherefore, intravenous lidocaine is the most appropriate pharmacologic agent for immediate suppression of the arrhythmia in this acute electrical storm scenario.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T125426901Z_gemini-3-pro-preview_seed124", "question_id": "20251129T125426901Z_gemini-3-pro-preview_seed124-007", "question": "A 32-year-old female presents with subacute confusion, bilateral hearing loss, and visual field deficits.

However, azithromycin is a more established and convenient alternative for chlamydial treatment failure.\n\nConsidering the lack of improvement with doxycycline, azithromycin is the most appropriate next step as an alternative treatment for *Chlamydia trachomatis*.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T125426901Z_gemini-3-pro-preview_seed124", "question_id": "20251129T125426901Z_gemini-3-pro-preview_seed124-009", "question": "A 70-year-old man is evaluated for macrocytic anemia (MCV 105), thrombocytopenia, and recurrent inflammation of the ear and nose cartilage.

Let's break down why:\n\n*   **Age and Sex:** VEXAS syndrome predominantly affects older men.\n*   **Macrocytic Anemia:** This is a common hematological finding in VEXAS syndrome.\n*   **Thrombocytopenia:** Another frequent hematological abnormality seen in VEXAS.\n*   **Recurrent Inflammation of Ear and Nose Cartilage:** This is a hallmark feature of relapsing polychondritis, but in the context of the other findings, it points towards VEXAS, which can mimic or co-occur with relapsing polychondritis.\n*   **Pulmonary Infiltrates:** Lung involvement is also described in VEXAS syndrome.\n*   **Bone Marrow Biopsy:** Hypercellularity with vacuolization of myeloid and erythroid precursor cells is characteristic of VEXAS syndrome. This vacuolization is a key finding.\n*   **Somatic Mutation in *UBA1*:** This is the defining genetic feature of VEXAS syndrome. *UBA1* is the gene encoding ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, and somatic mutations in this gene are the cause of VEXAS.\n\nLet's consider why the other options are less likely:\n\n*   **A. Relapsing Polychondritis:** While the patient has cartilage inflammation, VEXAS syndrome is a systemic inflammatory disease that can include relapsing polychondritis as a component, but the hematological findings and the *UBA1* mutation are specific to VEXAS.\n*   **B. Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS):** MDS can cause macrocytic anemia and cytopenias, and some forms can have vacuolization. However, the specific combination of recurrent cartilage inflammation, pulmonary infiltrates, and the *UBA1* mutation strongly favors VEXAS over typical MDS.\n*   **D. Sweet Syndrome:** Sweet syndrome is an acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis. While it involves inflammation, it typically presents with skin lesions and fever, and the hematological findings and genetic mutation are not characteristic.\n*   **E. Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis:** This is a vasculitis that can affect the respiratory tract and kidneys. While it can cause pulmonary infiltrates and inflammation, the specific cartilage involvement, macrocytic anemia, and the *UBA1* mutation are not typical features.\n\nThe presence of macrocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, recurrent cartilage inflammation, pulmonary infiltrates, characteristic bone marrow findings, and crucially, the somatic *UBA1* mutation, all point definitively to VEXAS syndrome.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T125426901Z_gemini-3-pro-preview_seed124", "question_id": "20251129T125426901Z_gemini-3-pro-preview_seed124-010", "question": "A 35-year-old female undergoes a cone biopsy for CIN 3.

LVSI is extensively present. She desires future fertility.\n\nLet's analyze the options based on NCCN guidelines for early-stage cervical cancer with fertility preservation in mind:\n\n*   **A. Simple trachelectomy:** This procedure removes the cervix but preserves the uterus. It is typically considered for early-stage cervical cancer (Stage IA2 or IB1) where the tumor is confined to the cervix and there is no lymph node involvement. While fertility-sparing, the extent of invasion and extensive LVSI might make this insufficient.\n\n*   **B. Radical trachelectomy with pelvic lymph node assessment:** Radical trachelectomy involves removing the cervix, parametria, and upper vagina, while preserving the uterus. This is a more extensive procedure than simple trachelectomy and is considered for early-stage cervical cancer with a desire for fertility preservation. Crucially, it is often combined with pelvic lymph node assessment (e.g., sentinel lymph node biopsy or pelvic lymphadenectomy) to evaluate for nodal metastasis, which is important given the presence of LVSI. The depth of invasion (2 mm) and horizontal spread (5 mm) are within the range where radical trachelectomy can be considered, especially with fertility preservation desired. Extensive LVSI is a significant risk factor for lymph node metastasis.\n\n*   **C. Conization with negative margins is sufficient:** While negative margins are ideal, a cone biopsy alone is generally not considered sufficient treatment for invasive cervical cancer, especially with LVSI. The extent of invasion and LVSI indicate a higher risk of residual disease or spread.\n\n*   **D. Simple hysterectomy:** A simple hysterectomy removes the uterus and cervix. This procedure would result in loss of fertility and is not the recommended approach when fertility preservation is desired.\n\n*   **E. Pelvic radiation therapy:** Pelvic radiation therapy is typically used for more advanced stages of cervical cancer or as adjuvant therapy after surgery for high-risk features. It is not the primary treatment for early-stage invasive cancer when fertility preservation is a goal.\n\nConsidering the patient's desire for future fertility, the presence of invasive carcinoma with LVSI, and the need to assess for lymph node involvement, radical trachelectomy with pelvic lymph node assessment is the most appropriate fertility-sparing surgical option that addresses the risk of nodal spread. The depth of invasion (2mm) is within the range for consideration of trachelectomy.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}]
