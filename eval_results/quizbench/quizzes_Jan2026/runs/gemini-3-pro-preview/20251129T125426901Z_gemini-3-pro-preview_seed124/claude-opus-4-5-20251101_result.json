The recommended management for fertility preservation in IA1 with LVSI is radical trachelectomy with pelvic lymph node assessment (sentinel node or dissection).", "generator_model": "gemini-3-pro-preview", "seed": 124, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "pred": "B", "model_outputs": "Let me analyze this case systematically.\n\nPatient characteristics:\n- 35-year-old female\n- CIN 3 with invasive squamous cell carcinoma\n- 2 mm depth of invasion\n- 5 mm horizontal spread\n- Extensive LVSI present\n- Negative margins\n- No lymphadenopathy on imaging\n- Desires fertility preservation\n\nFIGO Staging:\n- Depth ≤3 mm and horizontal spread ≤7 mm = Stage IA1\n- This patient has 2 mm depth and 5 mm spread = Stage IA1\n\nKey consideration - LVSI:\nThe presence of extensive LVSI is critical here. According to NCCN guidelines:\n\n- For Stage IA1 WITHOUT LVSI: Conization with negative margins can be sufficient for fertility preservation\n- For Stage IA1 WITH LVSI: The risk of lymph node metastasis increases significantly (up to 5-8%), and lymph node assessment becomes necessary\n\nManagement options for Stage IA1 with LVSI desiring fertility:\n- Radical trachelectomy with pelvic lymph node assessment (sentinel lymph node biopsy or pelvic lymphadenectomy) is recommended\n- Simple conization alone is NOT sufficient when LVSI is present because lymph node status needs to be evaluated\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n- A. Simple trachelectomy: Does not address lymph node assessment needed with LVSI\n- C. Conization alone: Insufficient due to LVSI - needs lymph node evaluation\n- D. Simple hysterectomy: Patient desires fertility; also doesn't address lymph nodes\n- E. Pelvic radiation: Not first-line for early-stage disease; would eliminate fertility\n\nThe answer is (B)"}]
