Paralysis is paused for a 'sedation holiday.' The ventilator waveform display subsequently shows a controlled breath delivered by the machine, followed immediately by a deflection in the flow waveform suggesting patient effort, which then triggers a second, stacked breath. Esophageal manometry reveals that the diaphragm electrical activity (EAdi) and negative esophageal pressure swing onset occur *after* the initiation of the first machine-delivered breath.
