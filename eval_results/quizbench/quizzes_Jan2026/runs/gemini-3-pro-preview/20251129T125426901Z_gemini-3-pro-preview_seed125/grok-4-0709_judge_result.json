Paralysis is paused for a 'sedation holiday.' The ventilator waveform display subsequently shows a controlled breath delivered by the machine, followed immediately by a deflection in the flow waveform suggesting patient effort, which then triggers a second, stacked breath. Esophageal manometry reveals that the diaphragm electrical activity (EAdi) and negative esophageal pressure swing onset occur *after* the initiation of the first machine-delivered breath.

Unlike double triggering (where a sustained patient effort triggers two breaths), reverse triggering is a reflex where the mechanical inflation of the lung stretches the diaphragm, inducing a muscle contraction *after* the breath has started.
