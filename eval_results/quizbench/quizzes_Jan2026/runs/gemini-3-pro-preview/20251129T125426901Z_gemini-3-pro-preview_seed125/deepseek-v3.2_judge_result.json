The stem provides classic CADASIL clues: migraine with aura, cognitive decline, lacunar stroke in a young patient without vascular risk factors, and the highly specific MRI finding of white matter hyperintensities involving the anterior temporal poles and external capsules. This constellation uniquely points to a NOTCH3 mutation. The alternatives are less defensible: GLA (Fabry disease) often involves kidney and heart; HTRA1 (CARASIL) typically lacks migraine and includes alopecia/spondylosis; APP (CAA/Alzheimer's) is not linked to this presentation; COL4A1 mutations often cause porencephaly and hemorrhages. No internal contradictions or missing critical details exist. The item is medically accurate and logically valid.
