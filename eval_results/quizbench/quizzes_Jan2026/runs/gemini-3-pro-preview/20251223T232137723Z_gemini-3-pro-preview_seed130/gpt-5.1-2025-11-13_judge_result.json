This is the classic Hakim triad (“wobbly, wet, wacky”) and characteristic gait apraxia of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). Absence of tremor or asymmetric rigidity also points away from Parkinson’s disease.\nOption analysis: (A) Parkinson’s disease often has festinating narrow-based gait with resting tremor and cogwheel rigidity, not a broad-based magnetic gait with early incontinence and dementia. (B) NPH perfectly matches triad and specific gait description—best answer. (C) Lumbar spinal stenosis causes neurogenic claudication, pain worse with walking/extension, relieved by flexion; does not explain cognitive changes or urgency as a triad. (D) Vascular dementia can cause gait disturbance and cognitive decline, but the magnetic gait with classic triad is more specific for NPH. (E) Cerebellar ataxia presents with wide-based, unsteady, lurching gait with dysmetria and nystagmus, not magnetic gait.\nMain medical issues: Pathophysiology and clinical associations are accurate and board-standard.
