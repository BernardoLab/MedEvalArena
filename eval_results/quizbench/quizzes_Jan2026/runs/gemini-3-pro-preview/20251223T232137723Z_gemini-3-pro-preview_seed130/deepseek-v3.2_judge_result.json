Verdict on keyed answer: Miskeyed. The stem describes a patient with ulcerative colitis, jaundice, pruritus, MRCP findings of multifocal strictures and dilations, elevated IgG4 (2x ULN), and a liver biopsy showing periductal concentric fibrosis ('onion-skinning') without abundant plasma cells. A trial of high-dose corticosteroids resulted in no biochemical improvement. The keyed answer is Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC). However, the presence of elevated IgG4 and the classic 'onion-skin' fibrosis, which is a hallmark of PSC, creates a diagnostic dilemma. The lack of steroid response argues against IgG4-SC, but the elevated IgG4 is atypical for classic PSC and could indicate an IgG4-SC variant or overlap. The biopsy finding of 'onion-skinning' without abundant plasma cells is classic for PSC, but the elevated IgG4 level is a red flag. Given the strict criteria for IgG4-SC (including histology with abundant IgG4+ plasma cells and steroid responsiveness), and their absence here, PSC remains the most likely diagnosis. However, the elevated IgG4 level (2x ULN) is a significant confounding factor that is not typical of classic PSC and may lead some to consider IgG4-SC. The keyed answer (B) is defensible but not uniquely so because the elevated IgG4 could be interpreted as a secondary elevation in PSC (as noted in the rationale) or as a primary feature of IgG4-SC. The item is miskeyed because the best answer is not clearly B; option A (IgG4-related Sclerosing Cholangitis) is also defensible given the elevated IgG4, though the lack of steroid response and absent abundant plasma cells on biopsy argue against it. The logical issue is miskeying (K) because a unique best answer exists (PSC) but the provided key is not that answer; however, upon closer inspection, the key is actually PSC, which is the intended correct answer. The miskeying arises from the ambiguity introduced by the elevated IgG4. The medical accuracy is mostly sound, but the elevated IgG4 level is a nuance that complicates the diagnosis. Minimal fix: Specify that the IgG4 elevation is a non-specific finding seen in a subset of PSC patients, and emphasize the absence of other IgG4-SC features (e.g., abundant IgG4+ plasma cells on biopsy) to make PSC the clear best answer.\", \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\", \"logical_validity\": false, \"medical_accuracy_score\":", "judge_output_valid": false, "judge_parse_error": "json decode error: Expecting value: line 1 column 2399 (char 2398)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251223T232137723Z_gemini-3-pro-preview_seed130", "question_id": "20251223T232137723Z_gemini-3-pro-preview_seed130-009", "question": "A 60-year-old female undergoes surveillance colonoscopy.
