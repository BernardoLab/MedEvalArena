Key stem clues: Persistent painful purple-brown nodules on extensor surfaces, histopathology showing leukocytoclastic vasculitis with concentric fibrosis ('onion-skinning'), and IgA monoclonal gammopathy. These findings are classic for erythema elevatum diutinum (EED). The first-line treatment for EED is dapsone, which is option C. However, the provided key is C, which matches the correct answer. Wait, the input states 'Correct answer key: C' and the answer explanation endorses dapsone. Therefore, the key is correct. I need to re-evaluate. The question asks for first-line treatment of EED. Dapsone is widely accepted as first-line. Prednisone (A) is often used but not first-line; it might be used initially for severe cases but dapsone is preferred for maintenance. Methotrexate (B), infliximab (D), and cyclophosphamide (E) are not first-line. So, dapsone is uniquely best. The item appears logically valid and medically accurate. But let's check for any issues. The stem is specific and diagnostic. The options are distinct. Dapsone is correct. So logical validity should be true, and logical_false_reason T. However, I must ensure no contradictions or underspecification. The stem does not mention any contraindications or prior treatments, so dapsone is appropriate. Medical accuracy: dapsone is indeed first-line for EED per dermatology textbooks and guidelines. Score likely 4 or 5. I'll set medical_accuracy_score to 5 because it is precise and board-relevant. Logical validity true. So analysis should reflect that. But wait, the instruction says: 'If logical_validity = true → logical_false_reason MUST be \\\"T\\\".' So I'll set logical_false_reason to \\\"T\\\". Now, for the analysis string: I need to summarize in 150-220 words. Structure: Validity label: V (since it's valid). Verdict: Correct best. Key stem clues: extensor nodules, histology with onion-skinning, IgA gammopathy → EED. Main logical issue: none. Main medical accuracy issue: none.

The stem describes a hemodynamically stable SVC syndrome patient with small cell lung cancer scheduled for emergent radiation. The keyed answer (C) suggests high dose per fraction (3-4 Gy) for the first few treatments. However, for SVC syndrome in small cell lung cancer, the standard emergent approach is typically either immediate chemotherapy (if chemo-sensitive tumor) or radiation with a conventional fractionation schedule (e.g., 1.8-2 Gy per fraction). High-dose-per-fraction regimens (like 3-4 Gy) are more commonly associated with palliative treatment for non-small cell lung cancer or other solid tumors, and carry a higher risk of late toxicity. For small cell lung cancer, which is highly chemo-sensitive, concurrent chemoradiation with standard fractionation is often preferred. Moreover, the option of concurrent chemotherapy (D) is a strong contender, and hyperfractionation (E) is also used in definitive treatment for small cell lung cancer. The stem lacks critical details about chemo-eligibility and intent (curative vs. palliative), making the unique best answer unclear. The keyed answer is not the most defensible based on standard guidelines.
