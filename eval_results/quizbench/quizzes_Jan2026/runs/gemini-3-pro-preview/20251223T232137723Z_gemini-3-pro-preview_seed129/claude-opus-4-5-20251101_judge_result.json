A pharyngeal flap is indicated for patients with good lateral wall motion (sagittal closure) or central gaps where the lateral walls can close against the flap. However, this patient has *poor* lateral wall motion but good AP motion (coronal closure defect). Wait, the stem says 'poor lateral wall motion but excellent anterior-posterior velar excursion'. This describes a coronal closure pattern defect? No, excellent AP motion means the velum moves back well. Poor lateral wall motion means the sides don't come in. A pharyngeal flap relies on lateral walls closing against the central flap. If lateral walls are poor, a flap will fail (ports remain open). A *sphincter pharyngoplasty* recruits the posterior tonsillar pillars (palatopharyngeus) to narrow the lateral ports and is indicated for poor lateral wall motion. However, if the gap is 'large central' and AP motion is good, a flap is often the default for central gaps, but the *classic* board answer for poor lateral wall motion is Sphincter Pharyngoplasty. Let's re-read carefully: 'poor lateral wall motion'. A pharyngeal flap requires functional lateral walls to close the lateral ports. Therefore, a pharyngeal flap is contraindicated or less effective. A sphincter pharyngoplasty creates a central dynamic sphincter and is best for poor lateral wall motion. Wait, let's look at the options. If the AP motion is excellent, the velum is working, but the lateral walls aren't. This is a 'black hole' or circular defect? No. Actually, if AP motion is good, the velum touches the posterior wall? If so, there is no gap. The stem says 'large central gap'. This implies the velum is short (despite moving well) or the pharynx is deep. If lateral walls don't move, a flap leaves open lateral ports. A sphincter pharyngoplasty builds up the lateral walls. Thus, Sphincter Pharyngoplasty (Option B) is the best physiologic match. *Correction*: The 'classic' teaching is: Good Lateral Wall Motion = Pharyngeal Flap.
