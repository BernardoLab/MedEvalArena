Key stem clues: Andersen-Tawil syndrome (ATS, LQT7) with KCNJ2 mutation, frequent non-sustained VT despite beta-blocker. The unique pathophysiology of ATS involves loss-of-function in the inward rectifier potassium channel, leading to prolonged terminal repolarization (prominent U waves). While flecainide is a sodium channel blocker, its use in ATS is not standard first-line therapy and is not uniquely effective per major guidelines. The established, guideline-supported pharmacologic management for ventricular arrhythmias in ATS, after beta-blocker failure, is typically a class 1B antiarrhythmic like mexiletine. This makes option D (Mexiletine) the most appropriate and defensible best answer based on current consensus, not option C. The item is medically inaccurate in its rationale. Minimal fix: Change the key to D (Mexiletine) and update the rationale to reflect guideline recommendations for ATS.\",\n  \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n  \"logical_validity\": false,\n  \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \"2\"\n}",

Key stem clues: G6PD-deficient patient with dapsone-induced methemoglobinemia (25%) deteriorates after methylene blue, with acute hemolysis and worsening hypoxia. This scenario uniquely indicates methylene blue is contraindicated and ineffective, creating a life-threatening emergency. The logical flow is sound: methylene blue fails and causes harm, so the next step must be a rescue therapy that does not rely on the G6PD pathway. Exchange transfusion (C) is the established definitive intervention to rapidly remove methemoglobin and damaged red cells. Alternatives are inferior: repeat methylene blue (A) would worsen hemolysis; ascorbic acid (B) is too slow; hyperbaric oxygen (D) is adjunctive, not definitive; hydroxocobalamin (E) is for cyanide, not methemoglobinemia. Medical accuracy is high, aligning with standard hematology/tox guidelines. Minimal fix: none required; item is clear and accurate.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"T\",\n    \"logical_validity\": true,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n

Key stem clues: nephrotic syndrome, low C3/normal C4, C3-dominant IF, MPGN pattern, and an abnormal serum free light chain ratio (5.0). The findings are classic for C3 glomerulopathy (C3G). The presence of a monoclonal gammopathy (MGRS) suggests a possible driving autoantibody. Main logical issue: The key (C, clone-directed chemotherapy) is not the single best answer. The vignette does not confirm a plasma cell clone; the abnormal light chain ratio alone, without confirmation of a monoclonal protein (SPEP negative), is insufficient to diagnose MGRS and justify chemotherapy. Eculizumab (A) is a first-line, evidence-based treatment for C3G. This creates a miskey (K) and a scenario where multiple answers are defensible (M). Main medical accuracy issue: Overstating the diagnostic certainty for MGRS.
