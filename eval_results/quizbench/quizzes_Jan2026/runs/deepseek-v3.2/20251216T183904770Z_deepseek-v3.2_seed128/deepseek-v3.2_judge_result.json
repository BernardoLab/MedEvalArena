Verdict: Correct best. Key stem clues: prone positioning on Jackson table, rheumatoid arthritis on adalimumab (risk for spinal stenosis/instability), acute loss of lower extremity motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), MAP 65 mmHg. The item frames a spinal cord perfusion issue in prone spine surgery; MAP 65 mmHg may be inadequate given increased intra-abdominal/venous pressure compromising spinal cord perfusion pressure. The keyed answer (D) targets perfusion by raising MAP to 90 mmHg, aligning with spine surgery guidelines to maintain spinal cord perfusion pressure. Alternatives are inferior: increasing volatile anesthetic (A) or opioid (C) further suppresses MEPs; ketamine (B) may augment MEPs but does not address hypoperfusion; decreasing propofol (E) may help but perfusion is the primary concern given the acute loss and positioning. No contradictions or underspecification; MAP target is a standard intervention. Medical accuracy is sound. Minimal fix: none needed for validity; could add 'with known spinal stenosis' to underscore perfusion vulnerability.", "medical_accuracy_score": 5, "logical_validity": true, "logical_false_reason": "T", "verdict": "PASS", "fail_reason": "NA"}, "judge_verdict": "PASS", "judge_fail_reason": "NA", "judge_medical_accuracy_score": 5}, {"quiz_id": "20251216T183904770Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed128", "question_id": "20251216T183904770Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed128-019", "question": "A 40-year-old man with schizophrenia stable on clozapine develops fever, confusion, and muscle rigidity.

Verdict: Not uniquely determinable. The stem describes a plausible clinical sequence: NMS treated, then C. difficile colitis. The question asks for the 'specific immunologic mechanism' linking them. The keyed answer (C) proposes 'NMS-associated immunoparlysis,' a concept analogous to post-sepsis immunosuppression, but this is not a standard, widely taught pathophysiologic mechanism for NMS or C. difficile. The vignette lacks any data (e.g., leukocyte counts, functional assays) to support immunoparalysis over other options. Option A (agranulocytosis) is incorrect as clozapine was stopped and agranulocytosis does not typically present this way. Option B (anticholinergic effects) is less likely as the drug is discontinued. Option D (increased intestinal permeability) is a plausible contributor from rhabdomyolysis but not primarily immunologic. Option E (rebound cholinergic surge) is theoretical and not a recognized cause of C. diff. The item is underspecified because it requires accepting a non-standard mechanism (immunoparalysis) as the definitive answer without stem evidence.
