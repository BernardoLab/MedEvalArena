Verdict on keyed answer: Correct best. Key stem clues that drive a unique best answer include ketamine infusion for depression, initial dissociative symptoms and mood improvement, delayed (48 hours) severe agitation, paranoid ideation, visual hallucinations, and MRI showing new symmetric T2 hyperintensities in the splenium of the corpus callosum, pointing to a toxic-metabolic encephalopathy linked to ketamine's NMDA antagonism. Main logical issue(s): None; the stem provides sufficient discriminating findings (timing, symptoms, specific MRI location) to support A as uniquely best, with alternatives less fitting (B unlikely acute unmasking, C mismatched location and trigger, D atypical presentation/timing, E not characteristic of ketamine effects). Main medical accuracy issue(s): Mostly consistent with known ketamine neurotoxicity, including potential excitotoxicity from downstream glutamate dysregulation after NMDA blockade; however, 'NMDA receptor internalization' is a minor imprecision, as ketamine primarily blocks channels, though some literature suggests endocytosis in chronic exposure. The splenial lesion aligns with reversible splenial lesion syndrome (RESLES) from toxins/seizures, a plausible but rare complication of ketamine. Scenario is board-relevant for recognizing drug-induced encephalopathy. Minimal fix: Revise option A to 'Ketamine-induced excitotoxicity via compensatory glutamate surge following NMDA receptor blockade' for mechanistic precision.", "medical_accuracy_score": 4, "logical_validity": true, "logical_false_reason": "T", "verdict": "PASS", "fail_reason": "NA"}, "judge_verdict": "PASS", "judge_fail_reason": "NA", "judge_medical_accuracy_score": 4}]
