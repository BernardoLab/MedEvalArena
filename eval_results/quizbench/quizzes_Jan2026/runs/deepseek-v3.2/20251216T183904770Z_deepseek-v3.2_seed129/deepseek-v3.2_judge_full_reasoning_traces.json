Key stem clues: sudden fever, rigidity, tachycardia, diaphoresis, elevated CK and leukocytosis in a patient on clozapine strongly point to neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). The most likely precipitant in this classic NMS presentation is the addition of a high-potency D2 antagonist (option B), which is a well-established trigger. The keyed answer (C, linezolid) is a less common and more speculative cause via a serotonin syndrome mechanism, which is not the typical presentation described. The item is medically inaccurate in its prioritization. Minimal fix: Change the key to B and adjust the rationale to reflect that adding a potent D2 blocker to clozapine is a recognized risk for NMS, not linezolid.\",\n  \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n  \"logical_validity\": false,\n  \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \"2\"\n}",

Key stem clues: replaced common hepatic artery from SMA during pancreaticoduodenectomy for ampullary adenocarcinoma. The critical technical goal is to prevent hepatic ischemia while achieving oncologic resection. The gastroduodenal artery (GDA) is the key collateral pathway in this anatomic variant, making its preservation (option A) the standard, immediate, and most critical maneuver. Options B and D are more complex reconstructions, not the most critical initial step. Option C is irrelevant to a replaced common hepatic artery. Option E (total pancreatectomy) is not indicated for this vascular issue. The item is logically valid and medically accurate, aligning with surgical principles for managing this arterial anomaly.

The keyed answer (C) is not the standard of care for the intraoperative finding of diffusely ischemic small bowel with patchy necrosis. The stem describes a patient undergoing emergent laparotomy for diffuse peritonitis, with findings of diffuse small bowel ischemia and patchy necrosis but preserved mesenteric pulsations. This scenario, while suggestive of non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI), presents with established necrosis, which is a surgical emergency requiring resection. The immediate surgical management is resection of necrotic bowel (A), with the decision for anastomosis vs. stoma based on patient stability and bowel condition. Intra-arterial vasodilators (C) are a diagnostic/adjunctive treatment for NOMI without frank necrosis, not the primary surgical management when necrosis is already present. The main logical issue is the mismatch between the key and the defensible best answer. The medical accuracy issue is that answer C misrepresents the priority of intervention. Minimal fix: Change the key to A and adjust the rationale to emphasize resection of necrotic bowel as the immediate life-saving step, with possible mention of second-look surgery.\",\n

Key stem clues: sudden painless vision loss, high IOP (55 mmHg), shallow anterior chamber, cloudy cornea, RAPD, and a normal fellow eye with open angles point to acute angle-closure glaucoma. The definitive management for acute primary angle-closure glaucoma is laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) to relieve pupillary block. While phacomorphic glaucoma (lens-induced) is a differential, the vignette does not specify an intumescent cataract, making LPI the standard, immediate definitive intervention. The keyed answer (lens extraction) is a treatment for phacomorphic glaucoma, but the stem underspecifies the lens status, creating a miskey. Main logical issue: the key does not match the most defensible best answer from the provided information. Minimal fix: Add 'intumescent cataract noted on exam' to the stem to justify lens extraction as the definitive management.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n    \"logical_validity\": false,\n

Key stem clues: traumatic knee dislocation, confirmed popliteal artery occlusion, absent pulses, cool/pale foot indicating acute limb ischemia. This creates a limb-salvage emergency requiring immediate vascular repair to restore perfusion, per standard trauma protocols. Ligament reconstruction is elective and delayed to avoid complications. Logical issue: None; stem clearly prioritizes vascular compromise. Medical accuracy: Aligns with ATLS and vascular surgery principles—immediate arterial repair is mandatory, reconstruction delayed. Minor issue: 'Optimal timing' phrasing is slightly vague but standard. Minimal fix: Specify 'within 6 hours' in stem to reinforce urgency, though implied.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"T\",\n    \"logical_validity\": true,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n

Main medical accuracy issue: None; the management aligns with current guidelines. Sirolimus conversion is a well-established, targeted treatment in post-transplant KS due to its antiproliferative and anti-angiogenic effects via mTOR inhibition, while also providing immunosuppression. Alternatives are inferior: antivirals (acyclovir) are ineffective against HHV-8 latency, rituximab targets B-cells not spindle cells, IVIG is not specific, and local therapies (cryotherapy/vinblastine) are not systemic or targeted.

The stem describes clear drainage positive for urea after radical cystoprostatectomy with orthotopic neobladder. A CT cystogram shows no extravasation from the neobladder, but urea positivity confirms a urinary source. The most likely diagnosis is a leak from the ureteroneobladder anastomosis (option A), as this is a common early postoperative complication, and a cystogram may not reliably visualize a small or proximal ureteral leak.

Key stem clues: unilateral nasal mass, biopsy-confirmed inverted papilloma, CT showing extension into maxillary sinus with erosion of medial maxillary wall. The question asks for the surgical approach to minimize recurrence, which hinges on complete removal of the tumor and its attachment site. Endoscopic medial maxillectomy (A) is the modern standard for this localized disease, allowing visualization and resection of the medial maxillary wall attachment while being less invasive. Alternatives are less appropriate: Caldwell-Luc (B) provides limited visualization; lateral rhinotomy (C) and midface degloving (D) are more invasive external approaches not required here; radical maxillectomy (E) is excessive for benign disease. No logical contradictions or underspecification. Medical accuracy is sound. Minimal fix: none required; item is clear and accurate.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"T\",\n    \"logical_validity\": true,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n

Key stem clues: Young adult, progressive unilateral C8-T1 lower motor neuron signs (weakness, atrophy, denervation on EMG) with preserved sensation. This pattern is classic for Hirayama disease (monomelic amyotrophy). The most specific initial test is cervical MRI in flexion to detect dynamic cord compression/atrophy, making option A (MRI cervical spine) correct. However, the keyed answer is listed as 'A. A. MRI cervical spine with gadolinium.' Gadolinium is not specific for Hirayama; non-contrast flexion views are. The inclusion of 'with gadolinium' makes the keyed option less specific and introduces a minor inaccuracy, but A remains the best choice among the options. The item is logically valid otherwise, as a unique best answer exists. Main medical issue: The specified use of gadolinium is non-standard for this diagnosis. Minimal fix: Change option A to 'MRI cervical spine (including flexion views)' and keep it as the key.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n    \"logical_validity\": false,\n

Key stem clues: acute dissociative symptoms (depersonalization/derealization) in borderline personality disorder after stress, no psychosis/neurological deficits. The vignette describes depersonalization/derealization, which is a dissociative symptom seen in borderline personality disorder. While lamotrigine has some evidence in depersonalization-derealization disorder, the strongest evidence and first-line treatment for acute dissociative symptoms in borderline personality disorder is an antipsychotic (often low-dose atypical). The keyed answer (lamotrigine) is not the best-supported option given the clinical context. Main logical issue: a unique best answer exists (atypical antipsychotics), but the key is incorrect. Main medical accuracy issue: oversimplifies treatment hierarchy; atypical antipsychotics have stronger evidence for dissociation in BPD.

            "content": "{\n    \"analysis\": \"Validity label: V. Verdict on keyed answer: Correct best. The stem provides a specific anatomical clue: brisk arterial bleeding from a structure posterior to the common bile duct during hilar dissection. In standard anatomy, the right hepatic artery most commonly runs posterior to the common bile duct. The management implication of brisk arterial bleeding in a challenging laparoscopic field (dense adhesions) strongly supports conversion to open repair (laparotomy) for control, aligning with surgical principles for major vascular injury. The keyed answer (B) correctly identifies this vessel and the definitive management step. Alternatives are less likely: the proper hepatic artery is anterior to the duct (A); a replaced right hepatic artery from SMA is not typically in this precise posterior location (C); the gastroduodenal artery is inferior (D); and the cystic artery stump is associated with the gallbladder bed, not posterior to the CBD (E). No internal contradictions or critical missing details exist. Medical accuracy is sound. A minimal fix is not required, but specifying 'brisk arterial' and 'posterior to CBD' already provides adequate discrimination.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"T\",\n    \"logical_validity\":

Key stem clues: Postoperative day 3 after open AAA repair, abdominal distension, bloody diarrhea, and sigmoidoscopy findings of circumferential mucosal edema/ulceration limited to rectosigmoid to 25 cm are classic for acute ischemic colitis. This is a common complication from IMA interruption. The vignette specifies no signs of peritonitis, perforation, or failure to improve, making supportive care the initial step. Logical issue: None; the stem provides sufficient detail to rule out immediate surgery (B, E) or non-supportive medical therapy (A, C). Medical accuracy: The keyed answer (bowel rest and IV fluids) aligns perfectly with standard management for uncomplicated ischemic colitis. Minimal fix: None required for a valid item; to enhance clarity, one could explicitly add 'vital signs are stable and abdominal exam is soft without rebound tenderness' to further justify non-operative management.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"T\",\n    \"logical_validity\": true,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n

The logical flow is clear: after failed nonoperative therapy, manipulation under anesthesia (MUA) is the standard next step for early, non-mechanical stiffness, as supported by guidelines. No internal contradictions exist. Medical accuracy is sound, aligning with typical orthopedic algorithms.

The stem asks for the best aesthetic outcome for eyebrow restoration in a full-thickness forehead defect involving the eyebrow. The keyed answer (D, islanded scalp flap) is a valid hair-bearing option. However, option E (microvascular hair-bearing flap from the contralateral eyebrow) is explicitly described in the author's rationale as the 'ideal' choice, with the only drawback being that it is 'rarely indicated due to donor site morbidity.' This creates a logical contradiction: if the question asks for the 'best aesthetic outcome' without qualification for morbidity, the 'ideal' option (E) should be the key. The stem is underspecified (U) regarding the weight of donor morbidity, leading to a miskey (K). The main medical accuracy issue is the internal inconsistency in the rationale. Minimal fix: Revise the stem to specify 'best single-stage reconstructive option' or change the key to E and adjust the rationale to reflect a definitive contraindication.\",\n
