Beta-blockers/ACE inhibitors would be insufficient, transplantation is premature without addressing the underlying metabolic defect, defibrotide is for hepatic veno-occlusive disease, and advanced imaging would not change management.", "generator_model": "deepseek-v3.2", "seed": 126, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "pred": "E", "model_outputs": "The patient is a 6-year-old boy with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) presenting with progressive dyspnea and fatigue, indicative of worsening cardiac status. Echocardiography reveals restrictive cardiomyopathy with severe biventricular diastolic dysfunction and moderate pulmonary hypertension, and genetic testing confirms an RPS19 variant, confirming DBA. Cardiac complications, including various cardiomyopathies and diastolic dysfunction, are well-recognized in DBA.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA.  Initiation of high-dose beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors: While these medications are standard for heart failure, \"high-dose\" initiation in a child with *restrictive* cardiomyopathy (where the primary issue is diastolic dysfunction and impaired filling) can be problematic and requires careful titration. This is a general approach and may not be the *most appropriate next step* without further characterization of the cardiomyopathy's specific nature.\n\nB.  Referral for combined heart-lung transplantation evaluation: This is an option for end-stage heart failure refractory to all medical management. Given this is described as the \"next step,\" transplantation is premature, as optimal medical management and further investigation should precede such an aggressive referral.\n\nC.  Immediate discontinuation of corticosteroids and transition to defibrotide: Corticosteroids are a cornerstone of DBA treatment. Discontinuing them would likely worsen anemia and overall health. Defibrotide is indicated for sinusoidal obstruction syndrome/veno-occlusive disease, not typically for cardiomyopathy in DBA. This option is inappropriate.\n\nD.  Addition of L-leucine supplementation to current regimen: L-leucine is an amino acid that has shown promise in improving hemoglobin levels and reducing transfusion dependence in a subset of DBA patients by potentially modulating protein synthesis pathways. Reducing anemia and transfusion burden can alleviate cardiac strain. This is a direct therapeutic intervention aimed at improving the underlying disease and its sequelae.\n\nE.  Cardiac MRI with T1 mapping and extracellular volume quantification: Cardiac MRI is an advanced imaging technique that plays a crucial role in characterizing cardiomyopathies. For DBA, it is considered essential for precise diagnosis and guiding management of cardiac complications. T1 mapping and extracellular volume quantification can provide detailed information about myocardial tissue characteristics, such as fibrosis, edema, and infiltration, which is vital for understanding the specific pathophysiology of the restrictive cardiomyopathy in this patient and directing appropriate therapy.\n\nReasoning for the best choice:\nThe patient presents with severe cardiac dysfunction impacting his daily life. While L-leucine (D) is a relevant therapeutic option for managing the underlying DBA and its associated anemia, the prompt presents specific, severe cardiac findings. In the context of complex cardiomyopathies like restrictive cardiomyopathy within genetic syndromes, advanced imaging like Cardiac MRI is often necessary for a precise diagnosis and to guide comprehensive management strategies. Literature suggests that CMR is \"essential for precise diagnosis and management\" of cardiac complications in DBA. Therefore, obtaining a more detailed understanding of the myocardial structure and composition through CMR is a critical step to ensure that the overall management plan, including potential future therapies or optimizations of L-leucine or cardiac medications, is appropriately tailored to the specific cardiac pathology. Thus, detailed diagnostic assessment that informs management is very appropriate as the next step.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{E}$."}, {"quiz_id": "20251205T084024622Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed126", "question_id": "20251205T084024622Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed126-002", "question": "A 34-year-old pregnant woman at 32 weeks gestation presents with acute-onset severe hypertension (200/120 mmHg), headache, and visual disturbances.

Nitroprusside is contraindicated due to risk of cyanide toxicity to the fetus. Nifedipine XL has slow onset and is inadequate for acute control. ACE inhibitors like captopril are contraindicated in pregnancy due to fetal renal toxicity. Esmolol may cause fetal bradycardia and is less ideal than fenoldopam for pregnancy-associated hypertensive emergencies.", "generator_model": "deepseek-v3.2", "seed": 126, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "pred": "C", "model_outputs": "The patient presents with severe preeclampsia, characterized by severe hypertension (200/120 mmHg), headache, visual disturbances, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and elevated creatinine. She has already been initiated on magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis and aggressive antihypertensive therapy with labetalol and hydralazine. Despite these measures, her blood pressure remains persistently elevated, necessitating escalation of treatment.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\nA. Immediate initiation of nitroprusside infusion: Nitroprusside is a potent arterial and venous vasodilator but carries a risk of cyanide toxicity to the fetus, especially with prolonged administration. It is typically reserved as a last resort for severe hypertensive emergencies when other agents have failed and the risks are carefully weighed against the benefits. It's not the most appropriate *next* step given more favorable alternatives.\n\nB. Addition of oral nifedipine XL 30 mg daily: Oral nifedipine (especially extended-release) is a common and effective agent for managing chronic hypertension in pregnancy and also for acute situations when given as immediate-release. However, the patient has severe, acute-onset hypertension that is refractory to initial IV therapy. An oral medication, especially an extended-release formulation, may not provide the rapid blood pressure reduction required in such a critical situation and is less effective for acute hypertensive emergencies compared to IV agents.\n\nC. Intravenous fenoldopam infusion titrated to effect: Fenoldopam is a selective dopamine-1 receptor agonist that causes peripheral vasodilation. It has a rapid onset of action and is effective in lowering blood pressure. It can be titrated to achieve the target blood pressure. While its use in pregnancy is less common than labetalol or hydralazine, it is considered a viable option for severe hypertension refractory to standard therapy, particularly because of its rapid onset and titratable nature, and its potential renal benefits due to increased renal blood flow.\n\nD. Sublingual captopril 12.5 mg repeated every 30 minutes: Captopril is an ACE inhibitor. ACE inhibitors are generally contraindicated in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy due to the risk of fetal renal malformations, oligohydramnios, and fetal death. Therefore, this option is inappropriate.\n\nE. Intravenous esmolol bolus followed by continuous infusion: Esmolol is a short-acting, cardioselective beta-blocker. While beta-blockers are used in pregnancy for hypertension, esmolol is primarily used for controlling heart rate in tachyarrhythmias or specific situations like perioperative hypertension. Labetalol, which is already being used, is a mixed alpha/beta blocker and is a preferred agent. Esmolol is not typically the agent of choice for treating severe hypertensive crises in preeclampsia when other agents have failed, unless there's a specific indication like reflex tachycardia or supraventricular tachycardia.\n\nConsidering the patient's unresponsiveness to initial IV antihypertensives and the need for rapid and effective blood pressure control, fenoldopam infusion (C) is the most appropriate next pharmacologic intervention among the given choices because it is an IV-administered potent vasodilator that can be titrated to effect and has a more favorable safety profile in pregnancy compared to nitroprusside, while being more appropriate for acute control than oral nifedipine.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$."}, {"quiz_id": "20251205T084024622Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed126", "question_id": "20251205T084024622Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed126-003", "question": "A 58-year-old man with metastatic renal cell carcinoma on nivolumab and ipilimumab combination therapy presents with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.

Add tocilizumab 8 mg/kg IV\n\nThis patient is experiencing severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs) secondary to nivolumab and ipilimumab therapy, most likely due to pneumonitis given the respiratory failure and lymphocytic infiltrate on BAL. The clinical presentation suggests a refractory irAE, as there has been no improvement with high-dose corticosteroids after 72 hours.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. Infliximab is a TNF-alpha inhibitor. While it can be used for refractory irAEs, it is not typically the first-line agent for severe pneumonitis.\nB. Cyclophosphamide is a potent cytotoxic agent. It is usually reserved for very severe, life-threatening irAEs that are refractory to steroids and other immunosuppressants, such as severe colitis, encephalitis, or myocarditis.\nC. The patient is already on high-dose methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg/day). Switching to dexamethasone at 40 mg daily (which is substantially less than 2 mg/kg for most adults) would represent a dose reduction and is unlikely to be more effective. High-dose steroids are the cornerstone of management for irAE pneumonitis.\nD. Plasma exchange (PLEX) is indicated for severe irAEs, particularly pneumonitis and neurological toxicities, that are refractory to high-dose corticosteroids. It helps to remove autoantibodies and inflammatory mediators. Given the lack of improvement after 72 hours of high-dose methylprednisolone, PLEX is a standard next step in management.\nE. Tocilizumab is an IL-6 receptor antagonist. It is used for specific irAEs like CRS, hepatitis, or inflammatory arthritis, but is not the primary recommendation for refractory irAE pneumonitis.\n\nTherefore, plasma exchange is the most appropriate next step for refractory immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced pneumonitis.\n\nThe answer is (D)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251205T084024622Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed126", "question_id": "20251205T084024622Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed126-004", "question": "A 3-day-old term neonate presents with poor feeding, lethargy, and hypoglycemia (glucose 25 mg/dL).

Elevated ammonia suggests urea cycle defect. Absent reducing substances would argue against galactosemia. GALT enzyme deficiency confirms classic galactosemia, not the epimerase variant.

Newborn screening shows elevated galactose and galactitol. These findings are highly suggestive of a disorder of galactose metabolism.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\nA. Elevated serum ammonia level: While liver dysfunction can lead to elevated ammonia, it is not the most specific finding for galactosemia. Other inborn errors of metabolism can also cause elevated ammonia.\nB. Absent reducing substances in urine after lactose challenge: In classic galactosemia, lactose from milk is broken down into glucose and galactose. The galactose cannot be properly metabolized due to enzyme deficiency. This leads to elevated galactose in the blood and, consequently, in the urine. Therefore, reducing substances (like galactose) would typically be present in the urine if the infant is consuming milk. Absent reducing substances would be unexpected in this context and might point towards a different type of carbohydrate malabsorption.\nC. Normal glycogen content on liver biopsy: Glycogen storage diseases affect carbohydrate metabolism and can cause hypoglycemia and hepatomegaly, but they do not typically result in elevated galactose and galactitol. Therefore, normal glycogen content would not confirm galactosemia.\nD. Deficient activity of galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase in erythrocytes: Classic galactosemia (type I) is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT). Galactose-1-phosphate accumulates, leading to its diversion into toxic pathways, including the polyol pathway, which produces galactitol. Galactitol accumulation is responsible for many of the clinical manifestations, including cataracts and liver damage. Erythrocyte GALT activity assay is the gold standard diagnostic test for confirming classic galactosemia.\nE. Presence of cataract on ophthalmologic examination: Cataracts are a known complication of chronic galactose exposure due to galactitol accumulation in the lens. However, cataracts may not be present at birth or in the first few days of life and are a consequence of the disease rather than the primary diagnostic confirmation. The enzyme deficiency is the direct cause.\n\nGiven the clinical presentation and newborn screening results, the most specific finding to confirm the diagnosis of classic galactosemia would be the biochemical confirmation of the underlying enzyme defect.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$."}, {"quiz_id": "20251205T084024622Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed126", "question_id": "20251205T084024622Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed126-005", "question": "A 42-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid syndrome on warfarin (INR 2.5-3.5) presents with acute right leg pain and swelling.

Add hydroxychloroquine 400 mg daily to current regimen\nD. Initiate intravenous immunoglobulin 1 g/kg for two days\nE. Place an inferior vena cava filter\n\nRationale:\nThe patient has established antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) with a recent thrombotic event (extensive DVT) occurring despite therapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin (INR 2.5-3.5). Patients with APS, especially those with recurrent thrombosis or high antibody titers, often require more intensive anticoagulation than standard therapeutic ranges. International guidelines and expert opinion generally recommend a higher INR target (e.g., 3.0-4.0 or 3.5-4.5) for patients with APS who have experienced a thrombotic event while on warfarin. Switching to a direct oral anticoagulant like rivaroxaban is not recommended as first-line therapy for APS patients with thrombosis due to evidence suggesting potentially higher recurrence rates compared to warfarin. Hydroxychloroquine is a standard treatment for SLE but is not the primary acute management for breakthrough VTE in APS. IVIg is not indicated for acute DVT in APS. An IVC filter is generally reserved for patients with contraindications to anticoagulation or those with massive PE, neither of which is described here; the goal is to optimize anticoagulation. Therefore, increasing the warfarin target INR is the most appropriate step to manage this breakthrough thrombosis in APS.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251205T084024622Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed126", "question_id": "20251205T084024622Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed126-006", "question": "A 67-year-old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy (LVEF 25%) and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator presents with recurrent appropriate shocks for ventricular tachycardia.

Mexiletine (Class IB): This drug is generally less effective for ventricular arrhythmias in the setting of structural heart disease and can be proarrhythmic. It is not a preferred agent in this scenario.\nB. Sotalol (Class III with beta-blocking properties): Sotalol can be effective for VT. However, it carries a significant risk of QT prolongation and torsades de pointes, especially in patients with impaired ventricular function. While a possibility, other options might be considered.\nC. Dofetilide (Class III): Dofetilide is a potent Class III antiarrhythmic that is effective for both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. It prolongs repolarization and can suppress VT. Due to the risk of QT prolongation and torsades de pointes, it requires careful inpatient initiation with ECG monitoring and assessment of renal function. Given the patient's recurrent VT and ICD shocks, a potent antiarrhythmic is needed, and dofetilide is a suitable option that can be initiated safely under inpatient supervision.\nD. Ranolazine (Late Sodium Inhibitor): Ranolazine primarily helps with angina and has shown some utility in reducing ventricular arrhythmias, particularly non-sustained VT, in patients with ischemic heart disease.

Severe Immunodeficiency: Recurrent sinopulmonary infections, low IgG (450 mg/dL), very low IgA (10 mg/dL), and very low IgM (15 mg/dL), along with absent B cells on flow cytometry, strongly indicate a defect in B-cell development.\n2.  Neurological Abnormalities: New-onset ataxia, nystagmus, and diffuse cerebellar atrophy are significant neurological findings.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\n*   A. BTK gene mutation: Mutations in BTK cause X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). XLA is characterized by absent B cells and severe hypogammaglobulinemia, explaining the immunodeficiency and recurrent infections. However, neurological complications like ataxia and cerebellar atrophy are not primary features of XLA.\n*   B. CD40 ligand deficiency: This causes X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome (HIGM1). It impairs immunoglobulin class switching, leading to low IgG, IgA, IgE but typically normal or high IgM. B cells are usually present but not functionally mature. This patient has absent B cells and very low IgM, making this option unlikely.\n*   C. AICDA gene mutation: This causes autosomal recessive hyper-IgM syndrome (HIGM2). Similar to CD40 ligand deficiency, it affects class switching. B cells are present but cannot switch isotype. This patient has absent B cells and very low IgM, making this option unlikely.\n*   D. RAG1 gene mutation: Mutations in RAG1 lead to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). RAG1 is essential for V(D)J recombination, required for T and B cell receptor development. Severe RAG1 deficiency results in absent T and B cells, explaining the recurrent infections, absent B cells, and hypogammaglobulinemia. While CNS complications can occur in SCID, primary cerebellar atrophy, ataxia, and nystagmus are not the hallmark features caused directly by RAG deficiency itself.\n*   E. ATM gene mutation: Mutations in ATM cause Ataxia-Telangiectasia (A-T). A-T is classically characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasias, impaired T-cell immunity, and variable immunoglobulin deficiencies, often including IgA and IgG deficiency. The neurological triad of ataxia, nystagmus, and cerebellar atrophy is highly pathognomonic for A-T. While primary B-cell defects are less common than T-cell defects in A-T, severe reductions in B-cell numbers and function can occur as part of the broader immunodeficiency spectrum in A-T due to the DNA repair defect affecting rapidly dividing immune cells. Given the striking neurological findings, ATM gene mutation is the most likely candidate, assuming the absent B cells represent a severe but possible manifestation of the immunodeficiency associated with A-T.\n\nConsidering the specificity of the neurological symptoms for ATM mutations, and the documented occurrence of severe B-cell defects in A-T, the ATM gene mutation is the most likely explanation for the entire clinical presentation.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{E}$."}, {"quiz_id": "20251205T084024622Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed126", "question_id": "20251205T084024622Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed126-009", "question": "A 55-year-old man with alcoholic cirrhosis presents with hepatic encephalopathy refractory to lactulose and rifaximin.

We need to identify the option with the strongest evidence for reducing recurrent HE.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\nA. Daily polyethylene glycol 3350 17 g: Polyethylene glycol is an osmotic laxative. While promoting bowel movements is crucial in HE management, its primary use is for constipation. It's mechanistically similar to lactulose but does not represent a distinct therapeutic intervention with stronger evidence for refractory HE compared to other specific treatments.\n\nB. Empirical vancomycin 125 mg four times daily: Vancomycin is an antibiotic. While gut bacteria play a role in ammonia production, there is limited robust evidence to support the use of vancomycin for hepatic encephalopathy, and it is not recommended as a routine treatment according to major guidelines, especially when rifaximin is already being used. Long-term use also carries risks.\n\nC. Oral L-ornithine L-aspartate 6 g three times daily: L-ornithine L-aspartate (LOLA) is a combination of amino acids that aids in the detoxification of ammonia through the urea cycle and glutamine synthesis. Numerous studies and meta-analyses have demonstrated that LOLA can significantly reduce plasma ammonia levels and improve symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy. Although its place in therapy after failure of standard treatments and when TIPS is not an option is still debated, it has more consistent evidence supporting its efficacy in reducing ammonia and improving HE symptoms compared to the other pharmacological agents listed.\n\nD. Sodium benzoate 5 g twice daily: Sodium benzoate is used to conjugate with glycine to form hippuric acid, which assists in the excretion of nitrogenous wastes, including ammonia. While it has shown some efficacy in reducing ammonia levels, the evidence supporting its use for reducing recurrent HE is generally considered less robust than that for LOLA.\n\nE. Branch-chain amino acid supplementation three times daily: Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are often supplemented in liver disease to improve nutritional status and correct an imbalance between BCAAs and aromatic amino acids. While they may have some benefit, current guidelines often state there is \"no strong evidence to support the routine use of... branched-chain amino acids... in patients with hepatic encephalopathy,\" suggesting it is not the intervention with the strongest evidence for HE reduction itself.\n\nConsidering the patient has refractory HE and TIPS is unavailable, we are looking for the next best pharmacological option with the strongest evidence.

A key marker of this oxidative DNA damage is 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG).\n*   Trastuzumab targets the HER2 receptor. Its cardiotoxicity is thought to involve disruption of HER2 signaling pathways in cardiomyocytes, affecting cell survival, mitochondrial function, polarization, and autophagy. The mechanism is not directly mediated by massive ROS production and DNA damage in the same way as anthracyclines.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options based on this understanding and the goal of differentiation:\n\nA. Elevated serum troponin I with normal NT-proBNP: Elevated troponin indicates acute myocardial injury. While cardiotoxicity can involve some degree of injury, this combination suggests acute injury without significant heart failure volume overload, which is contrary to the patient's presentation of acute decompensated heart failure. Troponin elevation is not highly specific for differentiating the etiology of cardiotoxicity between trastuzumab and anthracyclines.\nB. Markedly elevated NT-proBNP with normal troponin: Elevated NT-proBNP is a sensitive marker of heart failure and ventricular dysfunction due to wall stretch. It would be expected in acute decompensated heart failure regardless of the cause. Therefore, it is not specific for differentiating between trastuzumab-induced and anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.\nC. Elevated soluble ST2 with normal galectin-3: Soluble ST2 and galectin-3 are markers associated with cardiac fibrosis and inflammation, which can occur in various forms of heart failure. While relevant to cardiac remodeling, they are not typically considered the most specific biomarkers for differentiating trastuzumab from anthracycline cardiotoxicity.\nD. Increased urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine: 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine is a direct marker of oxidative DNA damage. This type of damage is a significant mechanism underlying anthracycline cardiotoxicity. Trastuzumab's cardiotoxicity, mediated by different pathways, is less characterized by direct oxidative DNA damage as its primary insult. Therefore, an elevation in urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine would strongly suggest anthracycline-like toxicity, making it a specific biomarker for differentiating it from trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity.\nE. Elevated growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15): GDF-15 is a stress-responsive cytokine that is elevated in various types of heart failure and cardiotoxicity. Studies have shown it to be elevated in both anthracycline- and trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity. While it may indicate risk or severity, its elevation in both conditions makes it less specific for differentiating the underlying etiology compared to a marker directly reflective of anthracycline's mechanism.\n\nBased on the specific mechanisms of cardiotoxicity, elevated urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine is the most specific biomarker for identifying anthracycline-like cardiotoxicity and thus differentiating it from trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$."}]
