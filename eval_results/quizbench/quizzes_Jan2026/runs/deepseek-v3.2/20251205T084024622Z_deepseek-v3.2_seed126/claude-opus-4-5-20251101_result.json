He has been treated with chronic corticosteroids and transfusions, and now presents with restrictive cardiomyopathy with biventricular diastolic dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension.\n\nKey considerations:\n\n1. Iron overload: Chronic transfusions in DBA lead to secondary hemochromatosis/iron overload. Cardiac iron deposition is a major cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy in transfusion-dependent patients. This presents with diastolic dysfunction and can progress to heart failure.\n\n2. Diagnostic approach: Before determining definitive management, we need to confirm the etiology of the cardiomyopathy. Cardiac MRI with T1 mapping and extracellular volume (ECV) quantification is the gold standard for:\n   - Detecting myocardial iron deposition (T2* mapping)\n   - Assessing myocardial fibrosis\n   - Quantifying iron overload severity\n\n3. Option analysis:\n   - A: Beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors - may be used for heart failure but don't address the underlying cause\n   - B: Heart-lung transplant - premature without establishing etiology and trying medical management\n   - C: Defibrotide - used for hepatic veno-occlusive disease, not indicated here\n   - D: L-leucine - has been studied in DBA to improve erythropoiesis, but doesn't address cardiac iron overload\n   - E: Cardiac MRI with T1 mapping - essential to confirm iron overload cardiomyopathy and guide chelation therapy intensity\n\nThe most appropriate next step is to confirm the diagnosis of iron overload cardiomyopathy with cardiac MRI, which would then guide aggressive iron chelation therapy (likely with deferasirox or deferoxamine).\n\nThe answer is (E)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251205T084024622Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed126", "question_id": "20251205T084024622Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed126-002", "question": "A 34-year-old pregnant woman at 32 weeks gestation presents with acute-onset severe hypertension (200/120 mmHg), headache, and visual disturbances.

Nitroprusside infusion - Can be used in hypertensive emergencies but carries risk of cyanide toxicity to the fetus. Generally avoided in pregnancy unless absolutely necessary and only for short duration.\n\nB. Oral nifedipine XL 30 mg daily - Nifedipine (calcium channel blocker) is safe in pregnancy and is actually recommended as a second/third-line agent for severe hypertension in pregnancy. However, the extended-release formulation takes time to work, and this is an acute emergency.\n\nC. Intravenous fenoldopam - A dopamine-1 receptor agonist used for hypertensive emergencies. Limited data in pregnancy, but it has been used. It's not a first-choice agent in pregnancy.\n\nD.

Intravenous esmolol - An ultra-short-acting beta-blocker.

However, the physical findings of macroglossia, umbilical hernia, and hepatomegaly are classic features of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, which can cause neonatal hypoglycemia.\n\nWait - let me reconsider. The newborn screening showing elevated galactose and galactitol is the key finding here.

BCAAs help correct the amino acid imbalance (decreased BCAA to aromatic amino acid ratio) seen in cirrhosis. Several meta-analyses have shown BCAAs can improve hepatic encephalopathy manifestations and have evidence for reducing recurrent episodes. Guidelines (including EASL and AASLD) mention BCAAs as a potential adjunctive therapy.\n\nComparing the evidence:\n- LOLA and BCAAs both have substantial evidence\n- BCAAs have been studied specifically for preventing recurrent hepatic encephalopathy with positive results in meta-analyses\n- EASL guidelines suggest BCAAs may be used in patients intolerant or unresponsive to conventional therapy\n\nGiven the specific question about \"strongest evidence for reducing recurrent hepatic encephalopathy,\" BCAAs have demonstrated efficacy in multiple trials for this specific indication.\n\nThe answer is E"}, {"quiz_id": "20251205T084024622Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed126", "question_id": "20251205T084024622Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed126-010", "question": "A 34-year-old woman with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer on trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and docetaxel presents with acute decompensated heart failure. Echocardiography shows global hypokinesis with LVEF 20%, markedly reduced from baseline 55%. Which of the following biomarkers would be most specific for differentiating trastuzumab-induced cardiomyopathy from anthracycline-like toxicity?", "options": ["Elevated serum troponin I with normal NT-proBNP", "Markedly elevated NT-proBNP with normal troponin", "Elevated soluble ST2 with normal galectin-3", "Increased urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine", "Elevated growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15)"], "answer": "A", "answer_index": 0, "explanation": "Trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity typically presents with elevated troponin (indicating myocyte injury) but relatively preserved NT-proBNP (less volume overload/stretch), reflecting its mechanism of reversible HER2 receptor blockade without direct cellular damage. Anthracycline toxicity shows both elevated troponin and markedly elevated NT-proBNP due to irreversible cellular damage. ST2 and galectin-3 are fibrosis markers not specific to this distinction. 8-OHdG is oxidative stress marker. GDF-15 is elevated in various cardiac conditions.", "generator_model": "deepseek-v3.2", "seed": 126, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "pred": "B", "model_outputs": "Let me analyze this question about differentiating trastuzumab-induced cardiomyopathy from anthracycline-like toxicity.\n\nKey differences between these two types of cardiotoxicity:\n\nTrastuzumab cardiotoxicity (Type II):\n- Generally reversible\n- Not dose-dependent\n- Does NOT cause myocyte death/necrosis\n- No ultrastructural changes\n- Dysfunction is related to HER2 pathway inhibition affecting cardiac function\n\nAnthracycline cardiotoxicity (Type I):\n- Generally irreversible\n- Dose-dependent\n- Causes myocyte death and necrosis\n- Causes oxidative stress and DNA damage\n- Ultrastructural changes present\n\nNow analyzing the options:\n\nA. Elevated troponin I with normal NT-proBNP - Troponin elevation indicates myocyte necrosis, which is more characteristic of anthracycline toxicity (Type I), not trastuzumab.\n\nB. Markedly elevated NT-proBNP with normal troponin - This pattern would suggest cardiac dysfunction/wall stress WITHOUT myocyte necrosis. This is more consistent with trastuzumab cardiotoxicity where there's functional impairment but no cell death.\n\nC. Elevated soluble ST2 with normal galectin-3 - Both are markers of cardiac stress/fibrosis but not specific for differentiating these two types.\n\nD. Increased urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) - This is a marker of oxidative DNA damage, which would be elevated in anthracycline toxicity (which causes oxidative stress), not trastuzumab toxicity.\n\nE. Elevated GDF-15 - This is a general marker of cellular stress, not specific for differentiating these conditions.\n\nThe key distinguishing feature is that trastuzumab causes dysfunction WITHOUT myocyte death (normal troponin), while anthracyclines cause actual cell death (elevated troponin). Option B best captures this - elevated NT-proBNP (indicating cardiac dysfunction/wall stress from the low EF) with normal troponin (indicating no myocyte necrosis) would be most specific for trastuzumab-induced cardiomyopathy.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}]
