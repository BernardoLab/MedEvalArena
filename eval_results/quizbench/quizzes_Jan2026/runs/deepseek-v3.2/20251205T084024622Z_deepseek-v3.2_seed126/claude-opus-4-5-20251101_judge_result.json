The keyed answer (D, sacubitril/valsartan) is correct because it contains valsartan, an ARB that is absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy due to fetal renal toxicity, oligohydramnios, and potential fetal death, especially in the second and third trimesters. This is well-established medical knowledge. Alternative assessments: (A) Digoxin is pregnancy category C, safe for heart failure in pregnancy. (B) Hydralazine is a preferred antihypertensive in pregnancy, commonly used with nitrates for heart failure. (C) Isosorbide dinitrate is acceptable in pregnancy for afterload reduction. (E) Metoprolol is pregnancy category C, acceptable beta-blocker for heart failure management in pregnancy. No logical issues exist; the stem provides sufficient information to identify sacubitril/valsartan as the contraindicated agent.
