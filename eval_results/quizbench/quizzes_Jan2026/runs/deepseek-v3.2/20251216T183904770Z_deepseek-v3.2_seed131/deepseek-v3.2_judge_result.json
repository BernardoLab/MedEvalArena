The vignette strongly points to a metabolic encephalopathy, but the keyed answer (C) requires an unstated assumption of acute kidney injury (AKI). The stem explicitly states 'chronic kidney disease' and 'eGFR 28' but does not mention AKI or a change in renal function. Without evidence of AKI, donepezil toxicity is not the most likely diagnosis. The presentation is classic for uremic encephalopathy given the severe CKD, which is not an option.
