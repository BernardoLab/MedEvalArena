Key stem clues: mCRPC on enzalutamide, switched to docetaxel, develops symptoms and lab findings of secondary adrenal insufficiency (low cortisol, inappropriately normal ACTH) and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (low testosterone, low LH/FSH). The keyed answer (C) incorrectly attributes this to residual enzalutamide inhibiting CYP17A1. However, enzalutamide is an androgen receptor antagonist, not a direct CYP17A1 inhibitor (abiraterone is). The clinical picture is most consistent with secondary adrenal insufficiency from exogenous glucocorticoid (prednisone) suppression, a standard effect of docetaxel+prednisone therapy. Option A (docetaxel-induced autoimmune hypophysitis) is rare but plausible and fits the labs. This creates a 'M' (multiple defensible) secondary issue. Main medical issue: misattribution of CYP17A1 inhibition. Minimal fix: Change key to A or revise stem to specify patient is NOT on prednisone, making C impossible.\",\n  \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n  \"logical_validity\": false,\n  \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \"2\"\n}",

Key stem clues: recurrent acute aseptic meningitis symptoms (headache, photophobia, neck stiffness) with normal CSF cell count/protein/glucose and normal MRI, temporally linked to IVIG infusions in a patient with CVID. The question asks for the intervention most likely to prevent recurrence while maintaining immune protection. The keyed answer (A, switch to SCIG) is the standard management for IVIG-induced aseptic meningitis, as SCIG avoids the high peak IgG levels implicated in the pathophysiology. Alternatives are inferior: B (steroids) is not routine prophylaxis; C (product change) may help but is less definitive than SCIG; D (slower infusion) may reduce but not eliminate risk; E (discontinuing replacement) is dangerous in CVID.

Key stem clues: acute confusion/agitation, myoclonus, autonomic instability, triphasic waves on EEG, chronic kidney disease (eGFR 28), and donepezil use. The vignette strongly points to a metabolic encephalopathy, but the keyed answer (C) requires an unstated assumption of acute kidney injury (AKI). The stem explicitly states 'chronic kidney disease' and 'eGFR 28' but does not mention AKI or a change in renal function. Without evidence of AKI, donepezil toxicity is not the most likely diagnosis. The presentation is classic for uremic encephalopathy given the severe CKD, which is not an option. Among the given choices, A (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) is a more defensible best answer due to the myoclonus, rapid progression, and triphasic waves, though MRI is stated as unchanged. Main logical issue: The key forces an assumption (AKI) not supported by the stem. Main medical issue: Triphasic waves are strongly associated with metabolic/uremic encephalopathy, not specifically with donepezil toxicity. Minimal fix: Add 'acute kidney injury (serum creatinine increased to 3.2 mg/dL)' to the stem to justify choice C, or change the key to A and adjust the rationale.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\":

Key stem clues: metastatic HER2+ breast cancer (IHC 3+) with progression on first-line dual HER2 blockade + taxane, new PIK3CA mutation, and loss of HER2 amplification by NGS despite positive IHC. The most appropriate next therapy is not uniquely determined by the vignette. The keyed answer (B, trastuzumab deruxtecan) is a reasonable option but not definitively the single best. Option A (continue dual blockade + capecitabine) is also a strong, guideline-supported choice for progression on first-line HER2 therapy before switching to T-DXd. This creates a scenario where two options (A and B) are defensible, making the item logically invalid. Medical accuracy is sound, as all options are plausible agents. Minimal fix: Specify the patient's performance status and/or prior exposure to capecitabine to clarify if adding chemotherapy to current HER2 blockade (A) or switching to an antibody-drug conjugate (B) is preferred.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"M\",\n    \"logical_validity\": false,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n

Key stem clues: recurrent anaphylaxis with hypotension, normal tryptase/IgE, no mastocytosis, symptoms triggered by placebo challenge, elevated PGD2 with normal histamine/tryptase. This profile strongly suggests a non-IgE, mast-cell-independent process, specifically a prostaglandin-mediated disorder. The logical issue is miskeying: the unique best answer is omalizumab (A), which is FDA-approved and guideline-recommended for idiopathic anaphylaxis and mast cell activation disorders, even with normal IgE, and has a strong evidence base for reducing attack frequency. NSAID prophylaxis (E) is not standard preventive therapy for recurrent anaphylaxis and is not supported by guidelines for this presentation. Medical accuracy issue: the rationale incorrectly dismisses omalizumab's established role. Minimal fix: Change the key to A (Omalizumab) and update the explanation to reflect its use in idiopathic and mast cell activation-related anaphylaxis.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n

The stem clearly presents a high-risk surgical candidate being considered for TAVR, asking which factor most strongly argues against the procedure. The key discriminating factor is the established principle that TAVR is generally not indicated if life expectancy is less than 12 months, as the risks and recovery burden outweigh the potential benefit. Option C directly provides this factor. The other options (A, B, D, E) describe relative contraindications or comorbidities that require consideration but do not singularly and strongly argue against TAVR, as explained in the rationale. The item is logically valid, medically accurate, and supports a single best answer. No contradictions or underspecification exist.
