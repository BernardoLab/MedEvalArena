His current arterial blood gas (ABG) shows:\n- pH: 7.36 (normal range: 7.35-7.45) - This indicates a compensated or normal acid-base balance.\n- PaCO2: 48 mmHg (baseline PaCO2 55 mmHg) - This is elevated but improved from his chronic baseline and reflects resolution of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure. An elevated PaCO2 is expected in severe COPD.\n- PaO2: 85 mmHg on 2 L/min nasal cannula - This indicates adequate oxygenation.\n\nThe patient is alert and comfortable. The question asks for the next most appropriate step in management.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\nA. Gradually wean and discontinue supplemental oxygen to target a PaO2 of 55-60 mmHg: In patients with COPD and chronic hypercapnia, oxygen therapy should be carefully titrated. The goal is typically to maintain oxygen saturation (SpO2) between 88-92%, which corresponds to a PaO2 of 55-60 mmHg. Giving higher levels of oxygen can suppress the respiratory drive, leading to hypoventilation and worsening hypercapnia. The patient's current PaO2 of 85 mmHg on 2 L/min of oxygen is significantly higher than the target range. Therefore, weaning the supplemental oxygen is the most appropriate next step. The phrasing \"to target a PaO2 of 55-60 mmHg\" refers to the safe range if supplemental oxygen is still required after weaning, or as a goal to achieve during oxygen titration.\n\nB. Continue current oxygen therapy and plan for discharge home with home oxygen: While the patient may eventually need home oxygen, his current PaO2 of 85 mmHg on 2 L/min suggests he may be receiving more oxygen than necessary. It is prudent to attempt to wean his oxygen first to assess his true baseline requirement before planning for home oxygen.\n\nC. Increase oxygen flow to achieve a PaO2 > 88 mmHg: This is contraindicated in patients with COPD and chronic hypercapnia, as it can lead to excessive oxygen administration, suppress respiratory drive, and worsen hypercapnia.\n\nD. Obtain a venous blood gas to confirm the arterial values: The patient is alert, comfortable, and has an ABG that shows improvement. There is no clinical indication to obtain a venous blood gas for confirmation of arterial values in this scenario.\n\nE. Initiate acetazolamide 250 mg twice daily to accelerate renal compensation: Acetazolamide is used to promote diuresis and can help correct chronic respiratory acidosis by stimulating metabolic compensation (inducing a metabolic acidosis). However, the patient's pH is 7.36, which is within the normal range, and his PaCO2 has improved. There is no indication for acetazolamide at this time.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the most appropriate next step is to gradually wean the supplemental oxygen given the current PaO2 is higher than the recommended target for COPD patients at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$."}, {"quiz_id": "20251205T082731900Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed123", "question_id": "20251205T082731900Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed123-002", "question": "A 45-year-old woman with a history of recurrent calcium oxalate kidney stones presents with acute pancreatitis.

The CT scan shows diffuse pancreatic enlargement without necrosis or ductal dilation.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\nA. Primary hyperparathyroidism due to parathyroid adenoma: Elevated calcium and elevated PTH are classic signs of primary hyperparathyroidism. Hypercalcemia is a known risk factor for acute pancreatitis. The history of calcium oxalate kidney stones further supports a diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism, as it leads to increased urinary calcium excretion. This option aligns perfectly with all the presented findings.\n\nB. Autoimmune pancreatitis (IgG4-related disease): While autoimmune pancreatitis can cause diffuse pancreatic enlargement, the laboratory findings of hypercalcemia and elevated PTH are not typical features of this condition.\n\nC. Hereditary pancreatitis due to PRSS1 mutation: Hereditary pancreatitis usually presents earlier in life and is characterized by recurrent episodes of pancreatitis, often without clear metabolic causes like hypercalcemia. Given the strong metabolic findings, this is less likely.\n\nD. Hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis: Hypertriglyceridemia is a common cause of pancreatitis, but it requires very high triglyceride levels (typically >1000 mg/dL). There is no mention of triglyceride levels in the case, and the dominant abnormal findings relate to calcium and PTH metabolism.\n\nE. Pancreatitis secondary to a gastrinoma (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome): Gastrinomas are associated with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and can lead to pancreatitis, but they do not directly cause hypercalcemia or elevated PTH. While gastrinomas are part of MEN1 syndrome which can include parathyroid adenomas, the primary issue presented here is clearly hypercalcemia with confirmed hyperparathyroidism.\n\nBased on the elevated calcium, elevated PTH, and history of calcium oxalate stones, primary hyperparathyroidism is the most likely underlying cause of her acute pancreatitis.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251205T082731900Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed123", "question_id": "20251205T082731900Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed123-003", "question": "A 32-year-old woman presents with 3 weeks of progressive dyspnea and fatigue.

Repeat pericardiocentesis and initiate colchicine: While colchicine is effective in preventing recurrences of pericarditis, repeat pericardiocentesis is ultimately a temporizing measure for rapidly accumulating effusions causing tamponade. It doesn't provide a definitive solution for continuous drainage.\nB. Surgical creation of a pericardial window via subxiphoid approach: This procedure provides a more permanent drainage pathway for the pericardial fluid, preventing reaccumulation into the pericardial space and relieving the pressure on the heart. It is a standard and effective treatment for recurrent symptomatic pericardial effusions causing tamponade, especially when medical management or simple drainage is insufficient.\nC. Initiation of high-dose prednisone for suspected autoimmune pericarditis: While autoimmune pericarditis is a possibility, empirical treatment with steroids might not be sufficient to manage a large, rapidly reaccumulating effusion causing tamponade. A definitive drainage procedure is often prioritized in such cases, and steroids may be used adjunctively or if the underlying cause is definitively identified as inflammatory and responsive to steroids.\nD. Pericardiectomy via left thoracotomy: Pericardiectomy is a more extensive surgery, typically reserved for chronic constrictive pericarditis or very refractory cases of recurrent effusive pericarditis. It is not the first-line definitive management for a 32-year-old with subacute recurrent tamponade.\nE. Intrapericardial instillation of bleomycin: This is a sclerosing agent used for malignant effusions or effusions refractory to other treatments.

The NIHSS of 15 indicates a moderate to severe stroke. The CT head shows no hemorrhage, making reperfusion therapies possible if not for contraindications. The patient is on apixaban, a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC), and the vignette explicitly states he is \"not a candidate for IV tPA due to anticoagulation.\" This contraindication typically arises because the presence of the anticoagulant (especially within the 48 hours prior to symptom onset) increases the risk of hemorrhagic transformation after thrombolysis.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\nA. Administer IV tPA after checking an INR and anti-Xa level: Checking INR is irrelevant for apixaban. While an anti-Xa level can provide information about apixaban levels, the vignette states he is not a candidate for IV tPA due to anticoagulation, implying this decision has already been made and is not easily reversible in the acute setting for tPA administration.\nB. Proceed directly to mechanical thrombectomy without thrombolysis: Mechanical thrombectomy is the standard of care for patients with acute ischemic stroke due to LVO, especially when IV tPA is contraindicated or has failed. This option directly addresses the identified cause of stroke (LVO) with an effective reperfusion strategy.\nC. Administer IV protamine to reverse apixaban, then give IV tPA: Protamine sulfate is the reversal agent for unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparin, not for direct factor Xa inhibitors like apixaban. This option is pharmacologically incorrect.\nD. Administer andexanet alfa, then give IV tPA: Andexanet alfa is the specific reversal agent for apixaban. Theoretically, reversing apixaban could make the patient a candidate for IV tPA. However, the vignette states he is *not a candidate* for tPA. In the setting of a confirmed LVO and contraindication to tPA, mechanical thrombectomy is the primary reperfusion modality. While some centers might consider reversal followed by tPA in specific circumstances, proceeding *directly* to thrombectomy for an LVO when tPA is contraindicated is a more straightforward and often preferred approach, especially given that thrombectomy can be performed with or without preceding IV tPA. The decision to proceed directly to thrombectomy bypasses the complexities and potential delays of reversal if the primary goal is reperfusion of the LVO.\nE. Initiate IV heparin drip and observe for neurological improvement: Heparin is an anticoagulant and not a treatment for acute ischemic stroke reperfusion. Starting heparin acutely would not resolve the occlusion and could increase bleeding risk.\n\nConsidering the patient has a confirmed LVO and is stated to be not a candidate for IV tPA, mechanical thrombectomy is the most appropriate and direct intervention to restore blood flow and improve neurological outcomes.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."}, {"quiz_id": "20251205T082731900Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed123", "question_id": "20251205T082731900Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed123-005", "question": "A 55-year-old man with alcoholic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B) is admitted with hepatic encephalopathy.

Crucially, his urine sodium is <10 mEq/L and his urine osmolality is high at 550 mOsm/kg.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH): While SIADH can cause hyponatremia with inappropriately concentrated urine, it is typically characterized by a urine sodium >20 mEq/L (unless the patient is on a very low sodium diet or diuretics). The low urine sodium (<10 mEq/L) makes typical SIADH less likely.\n\nB. Acute tubular necrosis from sepsis: Sepsis can cause AKI. However, ATN is usually associated with impaired sodium reabsorption, leading to a urine sodium >40 mEq/L and a low urine osmolality (typically <350 mOsm/kg). This patient's findings (urine sodium <10 mEq/L, urine osmolality 550 mOsm/kg) are inconsistent with ATN.\n\nC. Hepatorenal syndrome type 1 (HRS-1): This condition is a form of functional renal failure that occurs in patients with advanced cirrhosis and ascites. It is characterized by severe renal vasoconstriction resulting in AKI, sodium and water retention, and hyponatremia. Key diagnostic features include low urine sodium (<10 mEq/L), high urine osmolality (reflecting maximal water reabsorption), and impaired renal function (elevated creatinine). The patient's history of cirrhosis, development of AKI, hyponatremia, low urine sodium, and high urine osmolality are classic findings for HRS-1. The clinically euvolemic state does not exclude HRS, as the primary issue is circulatory dysfunction.\n\nD. Pseudohyponatremia from hypertriglyceridemia: This is a laboratory artifact caused by a high concentration of lipids in the serum that displaces water, leading to a falsely low measured sodium. There is no information provided to suggest hypertriglyceridemia.\n\nE. Hyponatremia due to lactulose-induced diarrhea: While lactulose can cause diarrhea, leading to fluid and electrolyte losses and potentially hyponatremia and AKI, the patient is described as clinically euvolemic. If diarrhea were the primary cause of AKI and hyponatremia, hypovolemia would be expected.

Extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP): EPP is a radical surgical procedure involving the removal of the affected lung, pleura, diaphragm, and pericardium. It is an option for carefully selected patients with early-stage (e.g., Stage I/II) MPM. However, it is a highly morbid surgery, and often Pleurectomy/decortication (P/D) is preferred when possible. Furthermore, surgery is typically part of a multimodal approach.\n\nD.  Pleurectomy/decortication (P/D) followed by adjuvant chemoradiation: P/D involves removing the parietal and visceral pleura, aiming for macroscopic debulking of tumor while preserving the lung.

A cold nodule in the setting of diffuse uptake from Graves' disease is consistent with this diagnosis. The diffuse increased uptake is from the hyperplastic thyroid tissue affected by Graves', and the cold nodule is an incidental finding that is not contributing to the hyperthyroidism.\n\nB. Toxic multinodular goiter: In toxic multinodular goiter (TMNG), hyperthyroidism arises from multiple autonomously functioning nodules. The RAIU scan in TMNG typically shows heterogeneous uptake with areas of increased uptake corresponding to the functioning nodules (\"hot\" nodules) and suppressed uptake in the surrounding, non-functioning normal thyroid tissue. The description of \"diffusely increased uptake\" overall, with a *cold* nodule, is less characteristic of TMNG, which usually presents with patchy uptake localized to the hot nodules.\n\nC. Subacute thyroiditis: Subacute thyroiditis is an inflammatory condition that causes release of pre-formed thyroid hormone. During the hyperthyroid phase of subacute thyroiditis, the thyroid gland is inflamed and unable to trap iodine, leading to a characteristically *low* or suppressed radioactive iodine uptake. This patient's uptake is diffusely *increased*, ruling out subacute thyroiditis.\n\nD. Factitious thyrotoxicosis: This refers to intentional or unintentional ingestion of exogenous thyroid hormone. In this condition, the elevated thyroid hormone levels suppress the pituitary TSH, which in turn reduces the thyroid gland's own production and iodine uptake mechanism. Therefore, the RAIU scan in factitious thyrotoxicosis is typically *low* or suppressed. This patient's uptake is increased, ruling out factitious thyrotoxicosis.\n\nE. Marine-Lenhart syndrome (Graves' disease with a functioning nodule): Marine-Lenhart syndrome is defined as the coexistence of Graves' disease and a solitary, autonomously functioning (hot) nodule. The nodule in this patient's case is *photopenic* (cold), not functioning (hot). Therefore, this diagnosis is incorrect.\n\nBased on the diffusely increased radioactive iodine uptake, indicative of generalized thyroid overactivity, and the presence of a photopenic (cold) nodule, the most likely diagnosis is Graves' disease with a coexisting cold nodule. The hyperthyroidism is explained by the diffuse overactivity of the thyroid gland due to Graves' disease, and the cold nodule is an incidental finding.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$."}, {"quiz_id": "20251205T082731900Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed123", "question_id": "20251205T082731900Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed123-009", "question": "A 50-year-old man with diabetes mellitus and hypertension is found to have a serum potassium of 6.8 mEq/L on routine labs.

His hyperkalemia was partially corrected with IV calcium gluconate, insulin/dextrose, and albuterol, indicating an ongoing physiologic disturbance. Further workup revealed low serum aldosterone and elevated plasma renin activity.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Type 4 renal tubular acidosis (hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism): This condition is characterized by impaired potassium and hydrogen ion excretion by the kidneys, leading to hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis. The \"hyporeninemic\" part signifies low plasma renin activity (PRA). However, this patient has *elevated* plasma renin activity. Therefore, classic hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism is unlikely. While Type 4 RTA can be caused by either hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism or aldosterone resistance, the finding of elevated renin makes the specific descriptor in option A inconsistent with the patient's labs.\n\nB. Addison's disease: This is primary adrenal insufficiency, meaning the adrenal glands fail to produce adequate amounts of steroid hormones, including cortisol and aldosterone. Deficiency of aldosterone leads to impaired sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, resulting in hyperkalemia. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is activated by the low levels of effective circulating volume and aldosterone, leading to elevated plasma renin activity and angiotensin II. This profile of low serum aldosterone and elevated plasma renin activity perfectly matches the patient's findings and explains his hyperkalemia. Diabetes and hypertension are common comorbidities.\n\nC. Gordon's syndrome (pseudohypoaldosteronism type II): This is a genetic disorder characterized by hypertension, hyperkalemia, and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Paradoxically, it is associated with *elevated* serum aldosterone levels and suppressed plasma renin activity, due to a defect in renal tubule sodium transport sensitivity to aldosterone. This is opposite to the patient's hormonal findings.\n\nD. Spironolactone use: Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic and an aldosterone antagonist. It blocks the action of aldosterone, leading to hyperkalemia. As a result, the body senses a relative deficiency of aldosterone's effects, and plasma renin activity typically increases. While spironolactone can cause hyperkalemia and elevated renin, serum aldosterone levels can be normal or even high in response to the blockade and compensatory RAAS activation. However, the finding of definitively *low* serum aldosterone, along with elevated renin, is more strongly indicative of primary intrinsic adrenal failure (like Addison's) rather than receptor blockade by a drug, assuming no drug history is provided as an explanation.\n\nE. Rhabdomyolysis: This condition involves muscle breakdown and release of intracellular potassium into the bloodstream, causing hyperkalemia. However, it is not typically associated with specific hormonal changes like low aldosterone and elevated renin. Also, significant rhabdomyolysis substantial enough to cause potassium of 6.8 mEq/L usually presents with muscle pain, weakness, and dark urine; the patient is asymptomatic.\n\nBased on the hormonal findings of low serum aldosterone and elevated plasma renin activity, Addison's disease (primary adrenal insufficiency) is the most likely cause of the patient's hyperkalemia.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."}, {"quiz_id": "20251205T082731900Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed123", "question_id": "20251205T082731900Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed123-010", "question": "A 65-year-old man with a mechanical aortic valve (On-X) on warfarin presents with a transient ischemic attack.

The presence of a mechanical valve necessitates anticoagulation to prevent thromboembolic events. The patient presented with a transient ischemic attack (TIA), which is a thromboembolic event. His current INR is 1.8, which is subtherapeutic for his mechanical valve.\n\nThe most immediate and critical adjustment is to correct the subtherapeutic INR to the target range, as inadequate anticoagulation is the most likely cause for the TIA in this context.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\nA.  Increase warfarin dose to achieve INR 2.5-3.5; add aspirin 81 mg daily: This addresses the subtherapeutic INR, which is crucial. However, adding aspirin to warfarin (dual therapy) significantly increases bleeding risk. While aspirin might be indicated for secondary stroke prevention, it is typically considered after therapeutic anticoagulation is established and after a risk-benefit assessment of adding an antiplatelet agent to warfarin, especially in patients with mechanical valves. It's not always the first or \"most appropriate\" step without further justification.\n\nB.  Increase warfarin dose to achieve INR 2.5-3.5; no aspirin needed: This option directly addresses the primary issue: the subtherapeutic INR. Achieving therapeutic anticoagulation is the most important step to prevent further thromboembolic events. If the TIA was caused by the low INR, correcting it may be sufficient. Adding aspirin is a secondary consideration that increases bleeding risk and may not be necessary. This is a conservative and appropriate first step.\n\nC.  Switch to apixaban 5 mg twice daily: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) such as apixaban are generally not recommended for patients with mechanical heart valves, as they have been associated with a higher risk of thromboembolic events and bleeding compared to warfarin in this specific population.\n\nD.  Add clopidogrel 75 mg daily to current warfarin therapy: Adding a second antithrombotic agent (clopidogrel) to warfarin significantly increases the risk of bleeding. This is typically reserved for specific indications, such as recent stenting of a coronary artery, which is not mentioned in the scenario. The primary problem here is subtherapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin.\n\nE.  Discontinue warfarin and initiate dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel: Discontinuing warfarin in a patient with a mechanical aortic valve is generally contraindicated due to the high risk of valve thrombosis and embolization. Dual antiplatelet therapy is not a substitute for anticoagulation in this setting.\n\nComparing options A and B, option B is the most appropriate initial adjustment because it corrects the identified deficiency in the current therapy (subtherapeutic INR) and avoids the increased bleeding risk associated with adding an antiplatelet agent when it may not be immediately necessary. If the TIA recurs despite achieving a therapeutic INR, then adding aspirin or other measures would be reconsidered.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."}]
