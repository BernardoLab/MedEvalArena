His current PaO2 of 85 mmHg is appropriate, and targeting such low values isn't standard practice even in COPD patients.\n\nOption B: This patient has improved significantly - his pH is normal, PaCO2 is actually better than his baseline, and he's comfortable on low-flow oxygen. Planning for discharge with home oxygen assessment is reasonable. However, we need to consider if he meets criteria for long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT).\n\nOption C: Increasing oxygen to achieve PaO2 >88 mmHg is unnecessary. His current PaO2 of 85 mmHg is adequate, and excessive oxygen in COPD patients with chronic hypercapnia can suppress respiratory drive.\n\nOption D: There's no clinical indication to confirm arterial values with venous blood gas. The ABG results are consistent with clinical improvement.\n\nOption E: Acetazolamide is sometimes used for metabolic alkalosis or to stimulate ventilation, but this patient's pH is 7.36 (normal) and his PaCO2 is actually lower than baseline.

Type 4 RTA (hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism):\n- This is common in diabetics\n- However, it presents with LOW renin AND low aldosterone\n- This patient has HIGH renin, so this doesn't fit\n\nB. Addison's disease (primary adrenal insufficiency):\n- Causes low aldosterone due to adrenal gland destruction\n- The low aldosterone leads to compensatory HIGH renin (trying to stimulate aldosterone production)\n- This matches: LOW aldosterone + HIGH renin\n- Would cause hyperkalemia and hyponatremia\n\nC. Gordon's syndrome (pseudohypoaldosteronism type II):\n- Causes hypertension and hyperkalemia\n- Characterized by LOW renin and normal/high aldosterone\n- Doesn't match the lab findings\n\nD. Spironolactone use:\n- Aldosterone receptor antagonist\n- Would cause elevated aldosterone (compensatory) and elevated renin\n- Doesn't match (aldosterone would be high, not low)\n\nE. Rhabdomyolysis:\n- Would cause hyperkalemia from muscle breakdown\n- Wouldn't specifically cause low aldosterone with high renin\n- Would expect elevated CK, myoglobinuria\n\nThe combination of LOW aldosterone with HIGH renin indicates primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease). The adrenal glands cannot produce aldosterone despite elevated renin trying to stimulate production through the RAAS system.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251205T082731900Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed123", "question_id": "20251205T082731900Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed123-010", "question": "A 65-year-old man with a mechanical aortic valve (On-X) on warfarin presents with a transient ischemic attack.

In patients who have a thromboembolic event despite therapeutic INR, adding aspirin 75-100 mg is recommended. Since his INR was subtherapeutic at the time of the TIA, the first step is to optimize INR control. However, given the event, adding low-dose aspirin is now indicated based on PROACT and other trials. Direct oral anticoagulants (C) are contraindicated in mechanical valves. Dual antiplatelet therapy (E) is inferior to warfarin for valve protection.", "generator_model": "deepseek-v3.2", "seed": 123, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "pred": "A", "model_outputs": "Let me analyze this case systematically.\n\nPatient Profile:\n- 65-year-old man with mechanical aortic valve (On-X)\n- Currently on warfarin\n- Presented with TIA (transient ischemic attack)\n- Current INR: 1.8 (subtherapeutic; target is 2.5-3.5)\n- No bleeding history\n\nKey Considerations:\n\n1. Mechanical valve anticoagulation: Patients with mechanical heart valves require lifelong anticoagulation with warfarin. DOACs (like apixaban) are contraindicated in mechanical valves based on the RE-ALIGN trial, which showed increased thromboembolic and bleeding events with dabigatran.\n\n2. Subtherapeutic INR: The patient's INR of 1.8 is below the target range of 2.5-3.5, which likely contributed to the TIA. The warfarin dose needs to be increased to achieve therapeutic INR.\n\n3. Addition of aspirin: Current guidelines (ACC/AHA) recommend adding low-dose aspirin (75-100 mg daily) to warfarin therapy in patients with mechanical heart valves, particularly after a thromboembolic event. This combination has been shown to reduce thromboembolic events, though with a slight increase in bleeding risk.\n\n4. Why not other options:\n   - Option B: While increasing warfarin is correct, guidelines support adding aspirin, especially after a thromboembolic event\n   - Option C: DOACs are contraindicated with mechanical valves\n   - Option D: Clopidogrel is not the standard antiplatelet added to warfarin for mechanical valves\n   - Option E: Dual antiplatelet therapy alone is insufficient for mechanical valve thromboprophylaxis\n\nBest Answer: Increase warfarin to achieve target INR AND add low-dose aspirin 81 mg daily.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}]
