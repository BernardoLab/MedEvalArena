High-resolution CT shows diffuse ground-glass opacities with superimposed fine reticulation and subpleural sparing. Bronchoalveolar lavage reveals lymphocytic predominance (65%) with CD4:CD8 ratio of 0.8. Pulmonary function tests show a restrictive pattern with severely reduced DLCO (38% predicted).

LIP in connective tissue disease typically requires more aggressive immunosuppression beyond steroids alone. Mycophenolate mofetil is the preferred steroid-sparing agent for SLE-associated interstitial lung disease with this pattern. High-dose steroids alone (A) are insufficient for progressive LIP. Hydroxychloroquine cessation (C) is unlikely to reverse established ILD. Surgical biopsy (D) is unnecessary with characteristic HRCT and BAL findings.

Anti-MuSK (B) and anti-LRP4 (C) antibodies are associated with different MG subtypes but not specifically with paraneoplastic forms.
