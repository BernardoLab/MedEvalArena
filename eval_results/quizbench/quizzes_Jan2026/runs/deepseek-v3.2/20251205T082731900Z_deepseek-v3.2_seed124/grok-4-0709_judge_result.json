Verdict on keyed answer: Correct best. Key stem clues that drive a unique best answer: 2-hour acute painless monocular vision loss, hand motion acuity, pale retina with cherry-red spot and boxcarring (classic CRAO), and 90% right ICA stenosis suggesting embolic source. These imply urgent need for reperfusion to restore vision in acute CRAO. The clinical problem is identifying the most urgent intervention for acute CRAO likely due to carotid embolism. Key findings: positive (acute onset, fundus signs of ischemia, severe stenosis); negative (painless, no other systemic symptoms). Most likely diagnosis: embolic CRAO. Keyed answer E fits as targeted intra-arterial thrombolysis within 6-12 hours, offering potential vision recovery despite limited evidence. Alternatives: A (IV tPA) not standard for CRAO, risks without proven benefit; B (paracentesis) historical and ineffective; C (immediate CEA) addresses source but delays acute reperfusion, not for immediate vision salvage; D (HBO) has anecdotal support but not urgent or proven superior. Main logical issue(s): none; stem supports E as unique best for urgency. Main medical accuracy issue(s): IA thrombolysis consistent with some expert recommendations for acute CRAO, but evidence is limited and not guideline-endorsed as standard care (e.g., AHA lacks strong support); could mislead on efficacy.
