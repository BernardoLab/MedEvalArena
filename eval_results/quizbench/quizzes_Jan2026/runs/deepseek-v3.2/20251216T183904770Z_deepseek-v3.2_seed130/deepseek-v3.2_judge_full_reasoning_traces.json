The item asks for best long-term control preserving function. The keyed answer (A, HDAC6 inhibitor) is based on preclinical data, not established clinical standard of care. The most defensible best answer is C (conformal radiotherapy), as it is a standard, effective local control modality for symptomatic, unresectable vestibular schwannomas, even in schwannomatosis, despite a debated transformation risk. Observation (D) is inappropriate given significant brainstem compression. mTOR inhibitors (B) and chemotherapy (E) are not standard. Main medical issue: Answer A represents experimental therapy misrepresented as best. Minimal fix: Change key to C and adjust rationale to reflect current standard radiotherapy consideration for progressive, symptomatic tumors.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n    \"logical_validity\": false,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \"2\"\n}",

Key stem clues: severe bleeding from a radiation-induced gastric ulcer with visible vessel after high-dose SBRT, requiring durable hemostasis while minimizing perforation risk. Main logical issue: The keyed answer (D, EUS-guided cyanoacrylate injection) is not the standard of care for a non-variceal, non-malignant bleeding ulcer with a visible vessel. The universally accepted first-line intervention for a high-risk peptic ulcer with a visible vessel is endoscopic hemostasis, typically with dual therapy (e.g., epinephrine injection plus thermal coagulation or mechanical clip). Cyanoacrylate glue is reserved for gastric varices. Therefore, a unique best answer exists, but the provided key is incorrect. Main medical accuracy issue: Recommending an unproven, off-label, and potentially hazardous therapy (cyanoacrylate injection into a non-variceal ulcer bed) over established first-line endoscopic treatments is a major inaccuracy. Minimal fix: Change the key to A or B, representing standard endoscopic hemostatic techniques, and adjust the rationale accordingly.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n    \"logical_validity\":

The vignette describes recurrent postprandial pain and weight loss in a patient with Crohn's on vedolizumab, with normal CT angiography, gastric emptying, and laparoscopy. The keyed answer (A, mesenteric Doppler) is proposed to diagnose 'microvascular dysfunction,' a condition not established in standard gastroenterology for Crohn's or vedolizumab. The stem lacks critical details to rule in this novel pathophysiology or to rule out more common etiologies like small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO, option B) or Crohn's-related strictures/complications not seen on laparoscopy.

Key stem clues: recurrent sinopulmonary infections, bronchiectasis, absent IgA, markedly reduced IgG/IgM, absent B cells, and a specific mutation in the λ5 surrogate light chain gene. The question asks for the specific immunological abnormality explained by this mutation. The λ5 protein is a critical component of the surrogate light chain, which pairs with the μ heavy chain to form the pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR). A mutation in λ5 directly causes absence of the pre-BCR complex and its signaling, halting B cell development at the pre-B cell stage, consistent with the lab findings. Option C correctly identifies this. Alternatives are incorrect: A (heavy chain rearrangement) occurs earlier and is intact here; B (RAG deficiency) affects earlier VDJ recombination; D (BLNK/PLCγ) and E (BTK) affect signaling downstream of the pre-BCR.

Key stem clues: Immunosuppressed transplant recipient, MRI ring-enhancing lesions with target sign, CSF JC virus PCR positive, confirming PML. Main logical issue: The keyed answer (C) is not the single best answer. The cornerstone of PML management in iatrogenic immunosuppression is reduction of immunosuppression. While switching from mycophenolate to everolimus is a plausible immunosuppression reduction strategy, the most direct and evidence-based initial step is simply to reduce the overall immunosuppressive burden. Option A (reduce immunosuppression) is a more fundamental and universally accepted first step than the specific drug switch in C. The addition of mirtazapine is of unproven benefit. Main medical accuracy issue: The item correctly identifies PML and rules out other options, but over-specifies a non-standard first-line regimen as the 'most appropriate' management. Minimal fix: Change the key to A, or rephrase the stem to ask for a 'novel adjunctive therapy' rather than 'most appropriate management.'\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n

            "content": "{\n    \"analysis\": \"Validity label: K (Miskeyed). Verdict: Miskeyed. The keyed answer (B) suggests subtotal resection followed by targeted therapy, but the stem's description of a 'large suprasellar mass extending into the third ventricle' and the histology (papillary glioneuronal tumor) strongly indicates a need for maximal safe resection as the primary surgical goal, with adjuvant therapy considered postoperatively. Option A (gross total resection via endoscopic endonasal) is a defensible and often preferred first-line surgical strategy for accessible suprasellar lesions to obtain tissue diagnosis and debulk, making it a strong contender. The key's rationale prematurely prioritizes medical therapy over surgical cytoreduction, which is not the standard initial approach for a symptomatic, resectable low-grade glioma. The item is medically accurate but logically miskeyed. Minimal fix: Change the key to A or revise the stem to specify the tumor is unresectable or the patient is not a surgical candidate.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n    \"logical_validity\":

The most likely diagnosis is radiation myelopathy (A), given the classic presentation of early-delayed radiation myelopathy (transient, reversible, within weeks to months, often with cord edema extending beyond field), especially after a single 8 Gy fraction for spine metastasis. The keyed answer (C, paraneoplastic myelitis) is improbable as a 'most likely' cause; paraneoplastic syndromes are rare, and anti-amphiphysin is more strongly associated with breast/small cell lung cancer, not prostate cancer. No internal contradiction or underspecification.

The stem describes recurrent pancreatitis due to pancreas divisum with a Santorinicole (a cystic dilation of the dorsal duct) and failed minor papilla sphincterotomy. The keyed answer (A, total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation) is a drastic, last-resort option for severe, debilitating chronic pancreatitis, not typically the next step after a single failed sphincterotomy for an anatomic variant. The most appropriate definitive management in this scenario, per standard gastroenterology/surgical guidelines, is a surgical drainage procedure (D, Puestow procedure or its modifications like lateral pancreaticojejunostomy), which is the established treatment for recurrent pancreatitis due to ductal dilation from obstruction. The stem lacks justification for leaping to total pancreatectomy. Medical accuracy is mostly sound, but the key is not the best answer. Minimal fix: Change the key to D (Surgical dorsal duct jejunostomy).\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n    \"logical_validity\": false,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n    \t\n    \t\n

The most appropriate management is angiographic embolization (A) to control the bleeding, as it is minimally invasive and effective for posterior ulcers with vascular erosion, followed by percutaneous drainage (C) for the established retroperitoneal collection. Emergency laparotomy (B) is a high-risk option in a cirrhotic patient and is not the first-line for a contained retroperitoneal perforation with bleeding.

The stem clearly describes a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) phenotype with recurrent infections, failure to thrive, absent lymph nodes, profoundly decreased T cells, normal B cells, and absent mitogen response. The specific genetic finding of an ORAI1 missense mutation directly points to a defect in store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), which is essential for T cell activation. This makes option C uniquely correct. The other options are incorrect: A (thymic defect) is not indicated; B (VDJ recombination) would affect both T and B cells; D (ZAP-70 mutation) causes a different T cell signaling block; E (ADA deficiency) causes lymphopenia. No logical contradictions or missing details exist. The medical content is accurate and aligns with known immunology. Minimal fix: None required; the item is already clear and valid.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"T\",\n    \"logical_validity\": true,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n    \t\n    \t\n

Key stem clues: slowly enlarging scalp lesion in a patient returning from Bolivia (endemic for Paracoccidioides), biopsy showing granulomatous inflammation with small budding yeast, and culture showing dimorphism (mold at 25°C, yeast at 37°C). This classic presentation and microbiology uniquely point to paracoccidioidomycosis. The keyed answer (A, itraconazole for 6-12 months) is the guideline-recommended first-line therapy for localized, non-severe disease. Alternatives are incorrect: amphotericin B (B) is for severe/disseminated disease, voriconazole (C) is not first-line, posaconazole (D) is an alternative but not the standard first choice, and fluconazole (E) is less effective with higher relapse. No logical contradictions or missing details. Medical accuracy is sound.

Key stem clues: HIV patient with CD4 180, progressive neurological decline, MRI ring-enhancing lesions, negative CSF PCR for common pathogens, biopsy showing necrotizing encephalitis with bizarre astrocytes and intranuclear viral inclusions. The histopathologic description is classic for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) caused by JC virus, not CMV. CMV inclusions are typically intranuclear and intracytoplasmic, but 'bizarre astrocytes' are a hallmark of JC virus infection. The negative CSF PCR does not rule out JC virus CNS disease, as sensitivity is not 100%, especially with low viral load. A unique best answer exists but is not the keyed option. Main logical issue: The key (foscarnet for CMV) is incorrect given the pathologic findings point to JC virus, for which there is no established antiviral therapy (best answer would be optimization of ART and possibly mirtazapine or other experimental therapies, none listed). The item is medically inaccurate in its core association. Minimal fix: Change the biopsy findings to describe cytomegalic cells with intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusions (owl's eye) to support CMV, or change the key to reflect that no effective antiviral therapy exists for JC virus PML and the best answer among options is supportive care/ART optimization (not listed).\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n    \"logical_validity\": false,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \"2\"\n}",
