Verdict: Correct best. Key stem clues: 55-year-old with ADPKD, eGFR 35 mL/min/1.73m², acute left flank pain, CT showing 8cm left renal cyst with hyperdense material and fluid-debris level (suggestive of infection or hemorrhage), urinalysis with 25-50 WBCs but no bacteria, afebrile with normal BP. These drive suspicion for infected cyst, as pyuria without bacteriuria is consistent with cyst-confined infection in ADPKD, where urine cultures are often negative. Main logical issue(s): none; stem allows discrimination of unique best answer without contradictions or underspecification, as CT features and pyuria favor infection over simple hemorrhage, supporting intervention. Main medical accuracy issue(s): none; aligns with guidelines recommending drainage for large (>5cm) suspected infected cysts in ADPKD due to variable antibiotic penetration and need for culture confirmation. The item's logic is sound, reflecting that systemic signs may be minimal and antibiotics like beta-lactams penetrate poorly, while fluoroquinolones do but drainage is preferred for large cysts to prevent complications. Minimal fix: none needed.\n\nClinical problem: Most appropriate management for suspected infected renal cyst in ADPKD. Likely diagnosis: Infected cyst. Keyed answer B fits: enables diagnosis via culture and therapy via drainage, crucial for large cysts.
