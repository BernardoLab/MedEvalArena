Key stem clues: Marfan syndrome, tearing interscapular pain, pulse deficit (right vs. left arm BP difference), widened mediastinum, normal aortic root on bedside echo. These strongly suggest acute aortic dissection, likely Stanford type B given normal aortic root. The immediate priority is to reduce shear stress via heart rate and blood pressure control before definitive imaging. However, the keyed answer (C) targets heart rate <60 bpm, which is overly aggressive and not the standard initial target; guidelines typically target HR 60-80 bpm and systolic BP 100-120 mmHg. Option A (labetalol) is a correct first-line agent, but its specified target (<120 mmHg) is acceptable, though slightly aggressive. Option A is defensible as best because labetalol is a combined alpha/beta-blocker often used first-line, and its target is closer to standard than C's HR <60. Thus, C is miskeyed; A is a better answer. Logical issue: Miskeying due to an overly restrictive heart rate target in the correct option. Medical accuracy issue: The specified HR target in C is too low and could be harmful. Minimal fix: Change option C's target to 'heart rate <80 bpm' to align with guidelines, making it the clear best answer.\",\n  \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n  \"logical_validity\": false,\n  \"medical_accuracy_score\": \n  \"4\"\n}",

Key stem clues: Acute urinary retention with Foley placement, followed by confusion, hypotension, tachycardia, and severe hyponatremia (118 mEq/L) with high urine sodium (80 mEq/L), high urine osmolality (450 mOsm/kg), and low serum osmolality (255 mOsm/kg). The clinical picture indicates hyponatremia with volume depletion (hypotension, tachycardia) and inappropriate natriuresis. Main logical issue: The keyed answer (B, Cerebral salt wasting syndrome) is not the most likely cause in this context. CSWS is classically associated with intracranial pathology, not urinary obstruction. The most defensible best answer is C (Post-obstructive diuresis leading to volume depletion), as post-obstructive diuresis can cause volume depletion and hyponatremia due to sodium and water loss, and the scenario fits a typical complication after relief of urinary retention. Main medical accuracy issue: CSWS is not a recognized complication of urinary retention or Foley placement; the explanation incorrectly links it to a 'transient cerebral event' without evidence. Minimal fix: Change the key to C and adjust the rationale to explain how post-obstructive diuresis can lead to volume depletion and hyponatremia with high urine sodium due to ongoing natriuresis.\",\n  \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n  \"logical_validity\": false,\n  \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \"3\"\n}",
