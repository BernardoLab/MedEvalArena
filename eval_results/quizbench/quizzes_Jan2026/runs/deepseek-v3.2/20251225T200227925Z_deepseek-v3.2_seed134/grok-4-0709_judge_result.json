He has a history of Marfan syndrome. Vital signs: BP 180/110 mmHg in right arm, 100/60 mmHg in left arm, HR 120 bpm, SpO2 98% on room air. ECG shows sinus tachycardia.

Esmolol is the preferred agent as it is a short-acting beta-blocker; pure vasodilators like nitroprusside can increase shear stress if used without beta-blockade. While CT angiography (B) is the definitive diagnostic test, controlling hemodynamics first minimizes the risk of extension or rupture during the scan. Labetalol (A) is appropriate but the specified target is too aggressive initially; a systolic BP of 100-120 mmHg is the goal. Direct transfer (D) or TEE (E) without hemodynamic control is dangerous.", "generator_model": "deepseek-v3.2", "seed": 134, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "target_topic": "Emergency Medicine", "judge_model": "grok-4-0709", "judge_model_outputs_raw": "{\n  \"analysis\": \"Validity label: V.
