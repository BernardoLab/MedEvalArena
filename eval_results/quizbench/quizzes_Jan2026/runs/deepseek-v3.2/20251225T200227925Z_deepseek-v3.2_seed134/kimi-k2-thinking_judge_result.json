Esmolol is the preferred agent as it is a short-acting beta-blocker; pure vasodilators like nitroprusside can increase shear stress if used without beta-blockade. While CT angiography (B) is the definitive diagnostic test, controlling hemodynamics first minimizes the risk of extension or rupture during the scan. Labetalol (A) is appropriate but the specified target is too aggressive initially; a systolic BP of 100-120 mmHg is the goal.
