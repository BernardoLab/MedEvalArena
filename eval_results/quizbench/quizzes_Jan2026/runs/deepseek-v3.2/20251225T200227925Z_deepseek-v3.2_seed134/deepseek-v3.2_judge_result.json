Esmolol is the preferred agent as it is a short-acting beta-blocker; pure vasodilators like nitroprusside can increase shear stress if used without beta-blockade. While CT angiography (B) is the definitive diagnostic test, controlling hemodynamics first minimizes the risk of extension or rupture during the scan.

Addison's disease"], "answer": "B", "answer_index": 1, "explanation": "This is cerebral salt wasting syndrome (CSWS), a rare cause of hyponatremia with natriuresis and volume depletion, often seen after neurosurgery or, as in this case, possibly after relief of urinary obstruction causing a transient cerebral event. The high urine sodium and volume depletion (hypotension, tachycardia) distinguish it from SIADH (A), which is euvolemic. Post-obstructive diuresis (C) can cause volume depletion but typically leads to loss of sodium and water, not isolated hyponatremia with high urine sodium. Psychogenic polydipsia (D) causes low serum and urine osmolality. Addison's (E) causes hyponatremia with hyperkalemia and low urine sodium.", "generator_model": "deepseek-v3.2", "seed": 134, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "target_topic": "Urology", "judge_model": "deepseek-v3.2", "judge_model_outputs_raw": "{\n  \"analysis\": \"Validity label: K (Miskeyed).

CSWS is classically associated with intracranial pathology, not urinary obstruction. The most defensible best answer is C (Post-obstructive diuresis leading to volume depletion), as post-obstructive diuresis can cause volume depletion and hyponatremia due to sodium and water loss, and the scenario fits a typical complication after relief of urinary retention. Main medical accuracy issue: CSWS is not a recognized complication of urinary retention or Foley placement; the explanation incorrectly links it to a 'transient cerebral event' without evidence.
