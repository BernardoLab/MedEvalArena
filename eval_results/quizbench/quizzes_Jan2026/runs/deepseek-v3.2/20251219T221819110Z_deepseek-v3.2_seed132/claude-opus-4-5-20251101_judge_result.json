Dose, technique, and age are minor factors compared to genetic predisposition. Concurrent aromatase inhibitors don't significantly increase radiation carcinogenesis. IMRT may increase low-dose bath but not necessarily secondary malignancy risk. The recurrence in-field is likely a recurrence rather than a radiation-induced second primary, but the question asks specifically about radiation-associated malignancy risk.
