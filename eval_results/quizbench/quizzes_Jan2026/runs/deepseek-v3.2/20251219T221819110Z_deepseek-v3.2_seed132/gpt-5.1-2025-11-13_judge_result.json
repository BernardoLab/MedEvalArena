Option A directly addresses dose–fractionation, which strongly influences both local control and risk of myelopathy. \nOption B is incorrect because limiting volume to only the involved body under-treats microscopic disease; standard volumes include the involved vertebra and usually one level above and below. Option C: omitting SIB is reasonable, but SIB is not standard and not clearly the pivotal parameter here. Option D: concurrent VEGF inhibitor management is nuanced and much less central to neurologic outcome. Option E is harmful; delaying RT ≥4 weeks worsens control. Minimal fix: Clarify in stem that conventional external-beam palliative RT is planned (not stereotactic), to avoid ambiguity.\n", "medical_accuracy_score": 4, "logical_validity": true, "logical_false_reason": "T", "verdict": "PASS", "fail_reason": "NA"}, "judge_verdict": "PASS", "judge_fail_reason": "NA", "judge_medical_accuracy_score": 4}, {"quiz_id": "20251219T221819110Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed132", "question_id": "20251219T221819110Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed132-020", "question": "A 58-year-old woman with BRCA2 mutation and bilateral breast cancer s/p bilateral mastectomies presents with isolated sternal metastasis.

Dose, technique, and age are minor factors compared to genetic predisposition. Concurrent aromatase inhibitors don't significantly increase radiation carcinogenesis. IMRT may increase low-dose bath but not necessarily secondary malignancy risk. The recurrence in-field is likely a recurrence rather than a radiation-induced second primary, but the question asks specifically about radiation-associated malignancy risk.
