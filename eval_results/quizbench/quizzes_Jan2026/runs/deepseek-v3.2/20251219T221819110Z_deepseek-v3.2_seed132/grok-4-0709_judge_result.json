Biopsy confirms estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative adenocarcinoma of breast origin. She receives 30 Gy in 10 fractions to the sternum with good pain relief.

Dose, technique, and age are minor factors compared to genetic predisposition. Concurrent aromatase inhibitors don't significantly increase radiation carcinogenesis. IMRT may increase low-dose bath but not necessarily secondary malignancy risk. The recurrence in-field is likely a recurrence rather than a radiation-induced second primary, but the question asks specifically about radiation-associated malignancy risk.
