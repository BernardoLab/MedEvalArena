Verdict on keyed answer: No defensible answer. Key stem clues that drive (or fail to drive) a unique best answer: 65-year-old with AF on apixaban (last dose 4 hours ago), acute aphasia and right hemiparesis, CT head showing 3 cm left MCA territory infarct without hemorrhage, NIHSS 18; these suggest acute ischemic stroke but lack confirmation of large vessel occlusion (LVO) via vascular imaging, failing to support any intervention definitively. Main logical issue(s): No option can be defended as best from the vignette alone, as thrombectomy options (C, D, E) require unstated LVO presence, while thrombolysis options (A, B) are contraindicated by recent DOAC use without reversal evidence or safety data; this stems from underspecification (U), leading to no defensible choice (N). Main medical accuracy issue(s): Intended teaching point aligns with AHA/ASA guidelines—mechanical thrombectomy preferred over thrombolysis in DOAC-associated LVO strokes due to bleeding risk, with reversal agents like andexanet not routine absent hemorrhage; however, vignette is clinically unrealistic by omitting LVO confirmation, a standard prerequisite for thrombectomy eligibility.
