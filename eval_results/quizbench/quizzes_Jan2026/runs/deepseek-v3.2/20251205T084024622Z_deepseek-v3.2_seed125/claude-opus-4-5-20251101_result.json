With an already hyperdynamic LV, adding inotropic support is not indicated and would increase oxygen demand.\n\nB. Phenylephrine - Pure alpha-agonist that increases afterload.

In fact, older age may increase transplant-related mortality, making this less of an indication.\n\nC. MRD positivity after consolidation therapy\nPersistent MRD after consolidation is a very strong adverse prognostic factor. MRD positivity indicates residual leukemia that is resistant to initial therapy and strongly predicts relapse. This is one of the most important factors in determining transplant eligibility.\n\nD. White blood cell count >30,000/μL at diagnosis\nHigh WBC at diagnosis is a poor prognostic factor, but it's a presenting feature rather than a response-based marker.\n\nE. Presence of additional cytogenetic abnormalities besides t(9;22)\nAdditional cytogenetic abnormalities (complex karyotype) can indicate higher risk, but the prognostic significance varies.\n\nThe key consideration here is that MRD status after treatment is the most powerful predictor of outcomes in ALL. The patient currently has 0.01% MRD after induction (which is MRD positive at the 10^-4 level). If MRD remains positive after consolidation therapy, this indicates treatment-resistant disease and is the strongest indication for proceeding to allo-HSCT.\n\nCurrent guidelines emphasize that persistent MRD positivity, especially after consolidation, is the most important factor driving the decision for transplant in Ph+ ALL, as it indicates that chemotherapy + TKI alone is unlikely to be curative.\n\nWhile IKZF1 deletion and other factors are important, MRD positivity after consolidation represents actual treatment failure/resistance and is the strongest indicator for transplant.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251205T084024622Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed125", "question_id": "20251205T084024622Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed125-007", "question": "A 65-year-old man with atrial fibrillation on apixaban presents with acute onset of aphasia and right hemiparesis.

Mechanical thrombectomy is indicated for large vessel occlusion (likely given the presentation and NIHSS 18) and can be performed regardless of anticoagulation status.

Andexanet alfa followed by mechanical thrombectomy - Andexanet alfa is the specific reversal agent for factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban, rivaroxaban).

Ileocecal valve involvement is important for absorption but doesn't dictate anastomosis vs ostomy. Pneumatosis may be present in non-necrotic bowel. Gastric perforation is managed separately. Abdominal compartment syndrome may require temporary closure but not necessarily jejunostomy.", "generator_model": "deepseek-v3.2", "seed": 125, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "pred": "B", "model_outputs": "Let me analyze this question about necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in a premature neonate and when a high jejunostomy would be mandated.\n\nOption A - Involvement of the ileocecal valve:\nWhile losing the ileocecal valve is significant (affects absorption and bacterial overgrowth), this alone doesn't mandate a high jejunostomy. Resection with anastomosis or ileostomy could still be performed.\n\nOption B - Necrosis extending to within 5 cm of the ligament of Treitz:\nThis is critical. When necrosis extends very proximally, close to the ligament of Treitz, there is insufficient proximal bowel length to perform a safe anastomosis. A high jejunostomy would be necessary because:\n- Primary anastomosis requires adequate healthy bowel margins\n- Anastomosis near the ligament of Treitz is technically difficult\n- The proximal jejunum is essential for nutrient absorption\n- A stoma allows the distal bowel to rest and potentially recover\n\nOption C - Pneumatosis in remaining bowel:\nPneumatosis indicates ongoing NEC, but if the bowel appears viable, it may be observed. This doesn't automatically mandate a high jejunostomy.\n\nOption D - Concurrent isolated gastric perforation:\nA gastric perforation would be repaired primarily. This is a separate issue and doesn't dictate the type of intestinal diversion needed for NEC.\n\nOption E - Abdominal compartment syndrome:\nThis would require decompression (leaving abdomen open with silo/patch), but doesn't specifically mandate a high jejunostomy versus other options.\n\nThe key principle is that when necrosis extends very proximally near the ligament of Treitz, there isn't enough healthy proximal bowel to create a safe anastomosis, making a high jejunostomy the only viable option.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}]
