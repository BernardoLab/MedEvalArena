It addresses the LVOT obstruction and SAM/MR. Importantly, myectomy removes the hypertrophied tissue (including fibrotic substrate) rather than creating more scar. Studies have shown that myectomy can reduce arrhythmia burden in HCM patients, likely by removing the arrhythmogenic substrate.\n\nOption C (Catheter ablation of VT): While this can be considered, VT in HCM is often related to the extensive fibrosis and substrate.

High-dose IV methylprednisolone - Corticosteroids have NOT been shown to be effective in GBS and are not recommended\nD.

Both IVIG and plasma exchange are considered equivalent first-line treatments for GBS. When one fails, switching to the other is appropriate. Combining them has not shown additional benefit, but using plasma exchange after IVIG failure in a deteriorating patient is reasonable.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed124", "question_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed124-009", "question": "A 55-year-old woman with mechanical mitral valve replacement on warfarin presents with acute onset aphasia and right hemiplegia.

Absence of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) on cardiac MRI\nLGE indicates myocardial fibrosis/scarring. The presence of LGE is associated with worse outcomes and lower likelihood of recovery in cardiomyopathies, including PPCM. Absence of LGE suggests potentially reversible myocardial dysfunction without permanent structural damage.\n\nB. Normalization of BNP levels\nWhile BNP normalization reflects improved hemodynamics, it's more of a marker of current status rather than a predictor of ultimate recovery potential.\n\nC. Presence of the TTN truncating variant\nTTN variants are found in ~15-25% of PPCM cases. Studies have shown that TTN truncating variants are actually associated with LOWER rates of complete recovery and more persistent LV dysfunction compared to PPCM without genetic variants.\n\nD. Baseline LVEF above 30%\nHer baseline was 25%, so this doesn't apply. While higher baseline LVEF can predict better outcomes, this is not the strongest predictor.\n\nE. Multiparity status\nMultiparity is actually a risk factor for PPCM but doesn't strongly predict recovery.\n\nThe strongest predictor of complete LV recovery in dilated cardiomyopathy/PPCM is the absence of myocardial fibrosis as detected by LGE on cardiac MRI. Fibrosis represents irreversible damage, while its absence suggests the myocardium has potential for full recovery. This has been validated in multiple studies of PPCM and other cardiomyopathies.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}]
