Option D (Low C3 with normal C4) is a strong, immediate laboratory marker of alternative pathway activation, consistent with aHUS and eculizumab use.

Key stem clues: peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) with TTN truncating variant, LVEF improved from 25% to 40% on GDMT, question asks for strongest predictor of *complete* LV recovery. The item correctly identifies absence of LGE on cardiac MRI as the strongest predictor, as LGE indicates irreversible fibrosis. The TTN variant (C) is a distractor, as it predicts *incomplete* recovery. Options B, D, and E are less predictive. Medical accuracy is sound, aligning with current literature on PPCM prognosis. Logical validity is intact: a single best answer is defensible based on established evidence.
