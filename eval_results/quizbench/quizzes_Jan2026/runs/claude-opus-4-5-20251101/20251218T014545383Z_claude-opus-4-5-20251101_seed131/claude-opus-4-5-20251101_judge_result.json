Laboratory studies reveal hemoglobin 7.2 g/dL, MCV 102 fL, WBC 3.8 × 10⁹/L, platelets 142 × 10⁹/L, reticulocyte count 0.8% (absolute 28 × 10⁹/L), and aPTT 78 seconds (normal 25-35). Mixing study shows partial correction of aPTT to 52 seconds at time zero and 58 seconds after 2-hour incubation at 37°C. Factor VIII activity is 2%, factor IX activity is normal, and Bethesda titer is 4.2 BU/mL. She develops a large retroperitoneal hematoma requiring transfusion. Recombinant activated factor VII is initiated with initial hemostatic control. Immunosuppression with prednisone 1 mg/kg daily is started. On hospital day 5, emicizumab 3 mg/kg subcutaneously is administered as a loading dose. On hospital day 8, the patient develops acute chest pain and dyspnea. CT angiography reveals bilateral subsegmental pulmonary emboli. D-dimer is markedly elevated at 8,400 ng/mL. The aPTT remains prolonged at 72 seconds. Chromogenic factor VIII assay (human reagents) is 12%, and chromogenic factor VIII assay (bovine reagents) is 8%. Repeat Bethesda titer is 3.8 BU/mL. Which therapeutic approach is the most appropriate next step in management?", "options": ["Initiate therapeutic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin and continue emicizumab", "Place an inferior vena cava filter and discontinue emicizumab", "Discontinue emicizumab, initiate therapeutic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin, and intensify immunosuppression with rituximab", "Continue emicizumab, place an inferior vena cava filter, and add cyclophosphamide to the immunosuppressive regimen", "Discontinue emicizumab, administer activated prothrombin complex concentrate for hemostatic coverage, and initiate therapeutic anticoagulation with fondaparinux"], "answer": "C", "answer_index": 2, "explanation": "This clinical scenario involves acquired hemophilia A (AHA) with the added complication of venous thromboembolism (VTE) developing in a patient on emicizumab therapy, presenting a challenging management situation. The central concern is that emicizumab produces thrombin generation via its factor VIIIa-mimetic mechanism, and the concurrent use of emicizumab with therapeutic anticoagulation or additional bypassing agents substantially elevates thrombotic risk. While the patient has an indication for anticoagulation due to pulmonary embolism, emicizumab therapy must first be stopped. The chromogenic factor VIII measurements (12% using human reagents) demonstrate ongoing emicizumab activity, though disease remission has not been attained (bovine reagent assay showing 8% with continuing inhibitor presence at 3.8 BU/mL). Low molecular weight heparin is the preferred anticoagulant over unfractionated heparin in this clinical context because it offers more consistent pharmacokinetic properties and eliminates the need for aPTT monitoring, which lacks reliability in AHA. Augmenting immunosuppressive therapy with rituximab is warranted given the insufficient response to corticosteroids alone after an 8-day period. Option A poses a contraindication due to thrombotic hazard when emicizumab is combined with anticoagulation. Option B neglects the requirement for anticoagulation in acute pulmonary embolism. Option D increases thrombotic risk by maintaining emicizumab alongside IVC filter insertion. Option E employs activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC), which when used with anticoagulation presents severe thrombotic risk, and fondaparinux monitoring would be challenging given the underlying coagulopathy. The essential principle is that emicizumab therapy must be halted prior to beginning therapeutic anticoagulation in AHA patients who experience VTE.", "generator_model": "claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "seed": 131, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "target_topic": "Hematology", "judge_model": "claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "judge_model_outputs_raw": "{\"analysis\": \"Validity label: V.
