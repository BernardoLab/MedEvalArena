Key stem clues: Recurrent neuroglycopenia 3-4 hours postprandially, rapid glucose drop from 180 to 45 mg/dL within 90 minutes after meals, normal gastric emptying, markedly elevated anti-insulin antibodies. The described pattern of a rapid drop within 90 minutes is inconsistent with the classic 'buffering and delayed release' mechanism (B), which typically causes hypoglycemia 3-5 hours postprandially. Instead, the rapid drop aligns better with antibody-mediated accelerated insulin clearance (A), where initial high antibody binding causes hyperglycemia, followed by rapid clearance of antibody-bound insulin complexes, leading to a swift decline in glucose. Main logical issue: The keyed answer (B) does not match the temporal pattern in the vignette. Main medical accuracy issue: The explanation for option B is medically accurate for classic IAS, but the vignette's timing contradicts it.

Key stem clues: severe persistent asthma with poor control despite high-dose inhaled therapy and omalizumab, elevated eosinophils (450 cells/μL), high FeNO (55 ppb), and frequent exacerbations. The question asks for the biologic switch most likely to provide additional benefit after omalizumab failure in a patient with clear type 2 inflammation biomarkers. Tezepelumab (D) is a defensible key as it targets TSLP upstream of multiple pathways and has evidence for efficacy post-omalizumab and across biomarker profiles. Alternatives are less optimal: anti-IL-5/IL-5R agents (B, C) and dupilumab (A) target more downstream Th2 pathways already partially addressed, while adding oral steroids (E) is a non-biologic step with significant side effects.

Key stem clues: WPW pattern on baseline ECG, documented antidromic AVRT (wide complex tachycardia with AV dissociation, RBBB morphology), and need to decide between ablation vs. medical management.

The keyed answer (D) is correct: the shortest pre-excited RR interval (SPERRI) during induced atrial fibrillation ≤250 ms is the standard high-risk marker for sudden cardiac death in WPW, favoring ablation. The logic is sound: SPERRI directly assesses the pathway's ability to conduct rapid atrial rates to the ventricle. Medical accuracy is high, aligning with ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines. Alternatives are correctly inferior: ERP (A) is less predictive; inducible orthodromic AVRT (B) and location (C) do not define high-risk; decremental properties (E) suggest lower risk.
