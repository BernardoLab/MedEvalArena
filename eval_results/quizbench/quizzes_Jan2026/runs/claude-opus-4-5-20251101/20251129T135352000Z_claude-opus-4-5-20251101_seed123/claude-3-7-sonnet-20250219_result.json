SPERRI ≤250 ms indicates high-risk pathway capable of conducting AF at rates that could degenerate to ventricular fibrillation, strongly favoring ablation. Accessory pathway ERP (A) is less predictive than SPERRI. Inducible orthodromic AVRT (B) and pathway location (C) don't indicate sudden death risk. Decremental properties (E) actually suggest lower risk.", "generator_model": "claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "seed": 123, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "pred": "D", "model_outputs": "To answer this question, I need to analyze the clinical scenario and determine which electrophysiologic finding would most strongly support catheter ablation over medical management.\n\nThe patient has:\n- Wide complex tachycardia with RBBB morphology, northwest axis, and AV dissociation\n- Post-conversion ECG showing Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome features (short PR, delta waves)\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Accessory pathway effective refractory period of 270 ms - This is a relatively long refractory period, suggesting lower risk.\n\nB. Inducible orthodromic AVRT - This confirms the diagnosis but doesn't necessarily indicate high risk requiring ablation.\n\nC. Accessory pathway in left lateral position - Location alone doesn't determine risk or need for ablation.\n\nD. Shortest pre-excited RR interval during induced atrial fibrillation of 220 ms - This corresponds to a very short refractory period (<250 ms) and rapid conduction over the accessory pathway, indicating high risk for ventricular fibrillation during atrial fibrillation.\n\nE. Decremental conduction properties - This is typically seen in slower conducting pathways and suggests lower risk.\n\nOption D indicates a high-risk accessory pathway with rapid conduction that could lead to ventricular fibrillation during atrial fibrillation, strongly supporting ablation over medical management.\n\nThe answer is (D)"}]
