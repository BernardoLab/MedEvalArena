Verdict on keyed answer: Correct best. Key stem clues that drive a unique best answer: 55-year-old with Child-Pugh B cirrhosis (MELD 18), single 3-cm HCC without extrahepatic spread or vascular invasion, patent portal vein, controlled ascites indicating portal hypertension, no encephalopathy, ECOG 0. These support BCLC stage A (early HCC) with impaired liver function precluding resection, favoring transplantation per guidelines. Main logical issue(s), if any: None; stem provides sufficient details for discriminating a single best option without contradictions or underspecification, as options align with BCLC treatment strata. Main medical accuracy issue(s), if any: None; aligns precisely with current BCLC staging and treatment recommendations, including Milan criteria for transplant eligibility and contraindications for resection in Child-Pugh B with portal hypertension. The clinical problem asks for the most appropriate BCLC-based treatment for early HCC in decompensated cirrhosis. Key findings: positive (single small tumor, transplant-eligible profile); negative (no advanced features). Implied: BCLC A requiring curative intent addressing both tumor and liver disease.

Examination reveals conjunctival injection, corneal edema with microcystic changes, a mid-dilated non-reactive pupil, and shallow anterior chamber OD. Intraocular pressure is 58 mmHg OD and 16 mmHg OS. Gonioscopy of the left eye shows narrow angles with appositional closure in the superior quadrant.

Laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) is the definitive treatment as it creates an alternative pathway for aqueous flow, relieving pupillary block. Critically, LPI must be performed on BOTH eyes because angle-closure is a bilateral anatomical predisposition-the fellow eye has a 40-80% risk of developing acute angle closure if left untreated, as evidenced by the narrow angles with appositional closure seen on gonioscopy OS. Trabeculectomy is reserved for cases with persistent IOP elevation after LPI. Phacoemulsification may be considered later but is not first-line.
