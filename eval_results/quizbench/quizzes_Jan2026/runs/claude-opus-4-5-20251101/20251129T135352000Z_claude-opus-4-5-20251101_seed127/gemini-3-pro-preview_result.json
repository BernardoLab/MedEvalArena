The decision between surgical myectomy and alcohol septal ablation (ASA) depends on anatomical and clinical factors.\n\n1.  Concomitant intrinsic mitral valve disease requiring repair (Option A): In HCM, mitral regurgitation (MR) is typically caused by systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve, which is secondary to the drag forces in the outflow tract. This type of MR usually resolves once the obstruction is relieved by either myectomy or ASA. However, if the patient has *intrinsic* mitral valve disease (e.g., leaflet prolapse, ruptured chordae, or significant calcification) that requires repair or replacement, simply relieving the septal obstruction via ASA will not correct the valvular pathology. Guidelines recommend surgical myectomy in patients who have other cardiac conditions requiring surgery (such as intrinsic mitral valve disease, multivessel coronary artery disease, or aortic stenosis). This is a Class I indication for surgery over ablation.\n\n2.  Patient preference for less invasive procedure (Option B): This would favor alcohol septal ablation, which is a percutaneous catheter-based intervention, over open-heart surgery.\n\n3.  Presence of atrial fibrillation requiring maze procedure consideration (Option C): While patients undergoing myectomy can benefit from a concomitant Maze procedure, atrial fibrillation can also be managed with catheter ablation or pharmacotherapy. Consequently, while this might tilt the decision toward surgery, it is not as absolute an indication as structural valve disease requiring repair.\n\n4.  Septal thickness greater than 20 mm (Option D): A septal thickness of 22 mm is suitable for both myectomy and ASA. Extreme hypertrophy (e.g., >30 mm) often favors myectomy because ASA may not produce a large enough infarct to relieve obstruction, and thin septums (<15-17 mm) favor myectomy due to the risk of ventricular septal defect with ASA. A thickness of 20-22 mm does not strongly favor one over the other.\n\n5.  Age greater than 55 years (Option E): Generally, surgical myectomy is the gold standard and is strongly preferred in younger patients (often defined as <60 or <65 years) given the concern for long-term arrhythmic risks (scarring) with ASA and the proven durability of myectomy. Older age or high surgical risk generally favors ASA. Thus, being over 55 does not strongly favor surgery compared to younger age; if anything, as age increases, the preference for the less invasive option (ASA) often increases.\n\nTherefore, the presence of intrinsic mitral valve abnormalities that require surgical correction is the strongest factor mandating the surgical approach.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed127", "question_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed127-002", "question": "A 6-year-old boy presents with recurrent episodes of weakness and dark urine following viral illnesses.

The MRI findings (bilateral posterior white matter hyperintensities) are classic for Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES). In SLE patients, PRES is commonly triggered by active lupus nephritis (causing hypertension and renal insufficiency) and the use of cytotoxic medications.\n\nThe diagnostic challenge is distinguishing PRES (a secondary, hemodynamic/metabolic complication) from primary Neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE) (an immune-mediated attack on the CNS, such as vasculitis or cerebritis).\n\nHere is the breakdown of the options:\n\n*   A. Presence of anti-dsDNA antibodies at high titer: High titers of anti-dsDNA correlate with systemic disease activity, particularly lupus nephritis. Since active nephritis and systemic inflammation are the most common predisposing factors for PRES in lupus, this finding is common in both PRES and NPSLE and does not distinguish between them.\n*   B. Low complement C3 and C4 levels: Similar to option A, hypocomplementemia indicates active systemic lupus. This is a risk factor for developing PRES (due to associated nephritis/HTN) and is also seen in NPSLE. It does not differentiate the etiology of the CNS symptoms.\n*   C. Elevated CSF IgG index with oligoclonal bands: This is the correct answer. PRES is caused by vasogenic edema typically due to endothelial dysfunction and autoregulatory failure; it is not an antibody-mediated attack on the brain parenchyma. Consequently, the CSF in PRES is usually acellular with elevated protein (due to blood-brain barrier breakdown) but does not show active intrathecal antibody synthesis. In contrast, primary NPSLE is characterized by inflammation within the CNS. The presence of an elevated IgG index and oligoclonal bands in the CSF (not typically seen in serum) indicates intrathecal immune activation, strongly suggesting an inflammatory etiology (NPSLE) rather than a hemodynamic one (PRES).\n*   D. Resolution of MRI findings with blood pressure control: This would confirm the diagnosis of PRES (as the name implies, it is reversible). The question asks what suggests NPSLE, making this the opposite of the correct choice.\n*   E. Concurrent lupus nephritis flare: Active nephritis is the strongest predictor for the development of PRES in SLE patients due to the associated hypertension and fluid overload. Thus, this finding would support a diagnosis of PRES rather than isolated NPSLE.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed127", "question_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed127-004", "question": "A 52-year-old man with type 2 diabetes presents for evaluation of recurrent hypoglycemia occurring 3-4 hours postprandially.

Diagnosis: The patient has the classic features of NIPHS:\n    *   History: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB).\n    *   Timing: Hypoglycemia occurs postprandially (3-4 hours after meals), not while fasting. This distinguishes it from classic insulinoma, which typically causes fasting hypoglycemia.\n    *   Labs: Elevated insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin during a hypoglycemic episode, with a negative sulfonylurea screen. This confirms endogenous hyperinsulinism.\n    *   Localization: Calcium-stimulated angiography (ASVS) localizes the insulin secretion to the body and tail of the pancreas. In NIPHS, the beta-cell hypertrophy (nesidioblastosis) can be diffuse or patchy, but the body and tail are frequently the dominant source, and ASVS typically shows a positive response in the splenic artery distribution.\n\n2.  Management:\n    *   First-line: The initial management of NIPHS is dietary modification (low-carbohydrate, frequent small meals) to reduce the postprandial glycemic excursion and the subsequent insulin surge. Acarbose (an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor) is the first-line pharmacologic agent added to diet; it delays carbohydrate absorption and blunts the glucose and insulin spikes.\n    *   Second-line: If diet and acarbose fail, treatment with octreotide (somatostatin analog) or diazoxide (K-ATP channel opener) can be attempted.\n    *   Third-line (Surgical): Distal pancreatectomy (resection of the body and tail) is reserved for patients who have severe, debilitating hypoglycemia refractory to medical management. While the ASVS results localize the disease and would guide this surgery, the procedure carries significant morbidity (e.g., surgical complications, secondary diabetes). Therefore, it is *not* the most reasonable *next step* for a patient presenting for evaluation who hasn't yet trialed conservative therapy.\n    *   Enucleation (Option E): This is the treatment for a discrete insulinoma.

Diagnosis: The clinical presentation—hypotonia, macroglossia, hepatomegaly, and severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in a newborn—along with elevated CK and reduced acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) activity, confirms the diagnosis of classic infantile-onset Pompe disease (Glycogen Storage Disease Type II).\n\n2.  Treatment: The standard treatment for Pompe disease is Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) with recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase (rhGAA).\n\n3.  Predictors of Response:\n    *   Cardiomyopathy (A): While severe, cardiomyopathy is a cardinal feature of the disease. ERT is actually notably effective at reducing cardiac mass and improving function in this condition, often more so than it improves skeletal muscle function.\n    *   CRIM Status (B): Patients are classified based on the presence (CRIM-positive) or absence (CRIM-negative) of endogenous non-functional GAA protein. CRIM-negative patients produce no native protein. Consequently, their immune system recognizes the infused recombinant enzyme as a foreign antigen. These patients typically mount a severe immune response, producing high titers of neutralizing antibodies against the drug. These antibodies render the ERT ineffective, leading to clinical decline and death despite treatment, unless prophylactic immune modulation is used. Therefore, CRIM-negative status is the most significant predictor of a poor response to ERT.\n    *   Age (C): Diagnosis at <1 month allows for earlier treatment.

Furthermore, catheter procedures may take time to organize, and the use of *any* lytic in a patient with INR 2.8 carries risk.\nOption E (Norepinephrine) is a supportive measure to maintain perfusion but does not treat the underlying cause (the obstruction) and is a bridge to definitive therapy, not the definitive step itself.\n\nGiven the contraindication to systemic lysis (INR 2.8) and the life-threatening nature of the condition, emergent surgical embolectomy is the most appropriate next step.\n\nThe answer is (D)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed127", "question_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed127-009", "question": "A 28-year-old woman with Graves' disease treated with methimazole 30 mg daily for 8 weeks presents with fever (39.2°C), severe sore throat, and malaise for 2 days.

This is a rare (<1%) but life-threatening idiosyncratic reaction to thionamides (methimazole and propylthiouracil).\n\nAnalysis of Options:\n*   A. Discontinue methimazole and initiate propylthiouracil: Incorrect. Due to documented cross-reactivity between methimazole and propylthiouracil regarding agranulocytosis, switching to the other thionamide is contraindicated.\n*   B. Discontinue methimazole, obtain blood cultures, and initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics with G-CSF: Correct. The immediate management of thionamide-induced agranulocytosis involves stopping the offending drug immediately. Because the patient has febrile neutropenia, she is at high risk for overwhelming sepsis. Standard management requires obtaining cultures (blood, urine, etc.) and starting broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics (with coverage for *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*) immediately. The use of Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF, e.g., filgrastim) is often recommended to hasten neutrophil recovery in symptomatic or severe cases.\n*   C. Continue methimazole at reduced dose with close monitoring: Incorrect. The drug must be stopped immediately; dose reduction will not reverse the idiosyncratic immune-mediated destruction of granulocytes and places the patient at fatal risk.\n*   D. Discontinue methimazole and proceed with urgent thyroidectomy: Incorrect. While surgery is a definitive treatment for Graves' disease, performing surgery on a patient with severe neutropenia and active fever/infection is extremely hazardous due to the risk of wound infection, sepsis, and healing complications. The patient must be stabilized first.\n*   E. Discontinue methimazole and initiate lithium carbonate: Incorrect. While lithium can be used to temporarily control hyperthyroidism by blocking thyroid hormone release, the priority here is the management of the hematologic emergency (febrile neutropenia). Initiating lithium does not address the immediate sepsis risk.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed127", "question_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed127-010", "question": "A 9-year-old boy with a history of Kawasaki disease at age 2 (treated with IVIG and aspirin, with documented giant coronary artery aneurysms) presents for routine cardiology follow-up.

Risk Stratification:\n    *   The patient has a 9 mm Right Coronary Artery (RCA) aneurysm with a Z-score of +12.\n    *   According to the AHA guidelines:\n        *   Small aneurysm: <5 mm or Z-score <5.\n        *   Medium aneurysm: 5–8 mm or Z-score 5 to <10.\n        *   Large/Giant aneurysm: >8 mm or Z-score $\\ge$ 10.\n    *   This patient has a Large/Giant aneurysm, placing him in Risk Level V.\n\n2.  Pharmacologic Management:\n    *   For Risk Level V (Giant Aneurysms), the AHA Guideline recommendation (Class I) is low-dose aspirin PLUS systemic anticoagulation with warfarin (target INR 2.0–3.0) or LMWH.\n    *   However, the guidelines also state that Dual Antiplatelet Therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel has been used as an alternative to warfarin, particularly in younger children or those with lower risk of thrombosis, although data is less robust than for warfarin.\n    *   The option \"Addition of warfarin\" to the current regimen of aspirin and clopidogrel would result in triple therapy, which is generally reserved for patients with a history of coronary artery thrombosis or very complex anatomy/high risk. It is not the standard recommendation for a stable, asymptomatic patient due to high bleeding risk. Switching to warfarin (stopping clopidogrel) would be reasonable, but \"Addition\" implies triple therapy, which makes Option A less optimal than Option E.\n\n3.  Activity/Sports Recommendations:\n    *   Risk Level V (Giant Aneurysms): The guidelines state that patients should be counseled to avoid contact or collision sports. Furthermore, \"participation in other competitive sports is not recommended\" (Class III) due to the risk of arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, or sudden death, regardless of ischemia status.\n    *   Risk Level IV (Medium Aneurysms): Participation in competitive sports may be allowed if the stress test is negative.\n    *   Since this patient has a Giant aneurysm (Risk Level V), the negative stress MRI does not clear him for competitive sports. The fact that he is currently \"active without limitations\" presents a significant safety risk that must be addressed immediately.\n    *   Therefore, restriction from competitive sports is the most strongly recommended safety intervention among the choices.\n\n4.  Other Options:\n    *   B: Discontinuing clopidogrel would leave the patient on aspirin monotherapy, which is inadequate for a giant aneurysm (requires DAPT or Anticoagulation).\n    *   C: \"Annual exercise stress testing only\" is incorrect because echocardiography is also required frequently, and \"only\" implies no other management changes (ignoring the sports restriction).\n    *   D: Coronary CT angiography is considered every 1–5 years, but it is not a more pressing recommendation than preventing sudden cardiac death via sports restriction.\n\nThe answer is (E)\n\nThe answer is (E)"}]
