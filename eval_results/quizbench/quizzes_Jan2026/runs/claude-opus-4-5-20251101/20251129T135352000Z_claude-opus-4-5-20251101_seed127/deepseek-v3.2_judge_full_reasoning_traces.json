Key stem clues: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with severe LVOT gradient, suitable septal perforator anatomy, no CAD, and NYHA class III symptoms despite maximal medical therapy. The question asks which finding most strongly favors surgical myectomy over alcohol septal ablation. The keyed answer (A) is correct: concomitant intrinsic mitral valve disease requiring repair is a well-established indication for surgery, as the procedure can address both pathologies. The other options are inferior: patient preference (B) is not a strong medical indication; atrial fibrillation (C) can often be managed percutaneously; septal thickness >20 mm (D) is not a contraindication to ablation (guidelines often cite >30 mm); and age >55 (E) is not a decisive factor. The item is logically valid and medically accurate.

Key stem clues: recurrent weakness/dark urine after illness, CK 45k, myoglobinuria, non-ketotic hypoglycemia with low free fatty acids, elevated C14:1/C14:2 acylcarnitines, and confirmed ACADVL mutations (VLCAD deficiency). This pattern is classic for a long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorder. The logic is sound: the defective enzyme is VLCAD, which processes long-chain fatty acids, so they must be restricted. Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) bypass the block and are a critical energy source. Option C directly addresses this pathophysiology. Alternatives are incorrect: A (avoid MCTs) is harmful, B (odd-chain) is irrelevant, D (high-protein) is for urea cycle/aminoacidopathies, E (carnitine alone) is insufficient.

The question asks which finding most significantly increases risk of rapidly progressive ILD (RP-ILD). While elevated ferritin (A) is a prognostic marker in established RP-ILD, the strongest independent risk factor for developing RP-ILD in anti-MDA5+ DM is the presence of the anti-MDA5 antibody itself, which is already stated in the stem. Among the listed options, anti-Jo-1 (C) is incorrect for this phenotype, and mechanic's hands (B), calcinosis (D), and elevated aldolase (E) are not the most significant risk predictors. However, the literature strongly indicates that within anti-MDA5+ disease, the titer of anti-MDA5 and the presence of specific clinical features (like cutaneous ulceration) are more significant risk predictors than ferritin alone for the development (not just severity) of RP-ILD. The keyed answer (A) is not the most accurate or defensible best answer given the stem's framing.

Key stem clues: Giant coronary aneurysms (≥8 mm, z-scores +12 and +9) in an asymptomatic child on dual antiplatelet therapy. Main logical issue: The key (A) is not the single best answer. The most strongly recommended intervention per current AHA guidelines for giant aneurysms is triple antithrombotic therapy, which the patient is already receiving (aspirin, clopidogrel, and warfarin). The stem states he is on aspirin and clopidogrel only, so the missing intervention is indeed adding systemic anticoagulation (warfarin). However, option A is phrased as 'Addition of warfarin,' which is correct, but the rationale incorrectly states the patient is already on triple therapy. The key is correct, but the provided explanation contains a factual contradiction. Main medical accuracy issue: The answer explanation misstates the patient's current regimen, creating internal inconsistency. Minimal fix: Correct the answer explanation to state the patient is on dual antiplatelet therapy, and adding warfarin completes the required triple therapy.\",\n  \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n  \"logical_validity\": false,\n  \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \"4\"\n}",
