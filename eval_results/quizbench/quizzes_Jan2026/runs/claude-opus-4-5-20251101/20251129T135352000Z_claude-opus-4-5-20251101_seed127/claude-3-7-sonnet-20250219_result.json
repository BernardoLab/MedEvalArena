This is due to high thrombotic risk within aneurysms. The absence of current ischemia does not reduce thrombotic risk. These patients require activity restriction from contact/collision sports but the antithrombotic intensification is the most critical missing intervention.", "generator_model": "claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "seed": 127, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "pred": "A", "model_outputs": "To answer this question, I need to consider the management of giant coronary artery aneurysms following Kawasaki disease.\n\nThis 9-year-old boy has:\n- History of Kawasaki disease at age 2\n- Giant coronary artery aneurysms (9mm RCA with z-score +12, 7mm LAD with z-score +9)\n- Currently on aspirin and clopidogrel\n- No symptoms or ischemia on stress testing\n\nAccording to current guidelines for management of Kawasaki disease with giant coronary aneurysms (defined as z-score ≥10 or absolute dimension ≥8mm):\n\n- These patients are at high risk for thrombosis and stenosis\n- Triple therapy with aspirin, a P2Y12 inhibitor (like clopidogrel), AND anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended\n- This is true even in the absence of symptoms or demonstrable ischemia\n- The target INR for warfarin in this setting is typically 2.0-3.0\n\nThe patient already has aspirin and clopidogrel but is missing warfarin, which would complete the recommended triple therapy for giant aneurysms.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}]
