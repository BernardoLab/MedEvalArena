Concomitant intrinsic mitral valve disease requiring repair\nThis would strongly favor surgery because surgical myectomy allows simultaneous mitral valve repair, which cannot be done with ASA.

Patient preference for less invasive procedure\nThis would favor ASA, not myectomy, as ASA is less invasive.\n\nC. Presence of atrial fibrillation requiring maze procedure consideration\nThis would favor surgery, as a maze procedure for AF can be performed concomitantly with myectomy but not with ASA.\n\nD. Septal thickness greater than 20 mm\nVery thick septum (>30 mm) might favor surgery, but 22 mm is not a contraindication to ASA. Some guidelines suggest ASA may be less effective with very thick septums, but 20 mm is not a strong cutoff.\n\nE.

Presence of cardiomyopathy at diagnosis - While cardiomyopathy is a serious manifestation, it actually often responds well to ERT, especially when treatment is started early.\n\nB.

Management requires immediate discontinuation of the offending thionamide (cross-reactivity precludes switching to PTU), blood cultures, broad-spectrum antibiotics covering Pseudomonas given febrile neutropenia, and G-CSF to accelerate neutrophil recovery. Continuing or reducing methimazole is dangerous. Urgent thyroidectomy in an agranulocytic patient carries prohibitive infection risk.

The severe neutropenia (ANC <500/μL, here it's 80/μL) with fever and sore throat indicates febrile neutropenia, which is a medical emergency.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\nA. Discontinue methimazole and initiate propylthiouracil\n- Incorrect. There is cross-reactivity between thionamides, and switching to PTU is contraindicated as agranulocytosis can occur with both drugs.\n\nB. Discontinue methimazole, obtain blood cultures, and initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics with G-CSF\n- Correct. This addresses the immediate life-threatening issue. The patient has febrile neutropenia requiring:\n  1. Immediate discontinuation of the offending agent\n  2. Blood cultures to identify potential pathogens\n  3. Empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics (covering Pseudomonas)\n  4. G-CSF to stimulate neutrophil recovery\n\nC. Continue methimazole at reduced dose with close monitoring\n- Incorrect. With severe agranulocytosis, methimazole must be stopped immediately.\n\nD. Discontinue methimazole and proceed with urgent thyroidectomy\n- Incorrect. Surgery in an actively infected, neutropenic patient is extremely risky. The immediate priority is treating the infection and neutropenia.\n\nE.

He is asymptomatic and active without limitations. Current medications include aspirin 81 mg daily and clopidogrel 75 mg daily.

This is due to high thrombotic risk within aneurysms. The absence of current ischemia does not reduce thrombotic risk. These patients require activity restriction from contact/collision sports but the antithrombotic intensification is the most critical missing intervention.", "generator_model": "claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "seed": 127, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "pred": "A", "model_outputs": "Let me analyze this case systematically.\n\nThis is a 9-year-old boy with history of Kawasaki disease with giant coronary artery aneurysms (defined as ≥8mm or z-score ≥10). He has:\n- RCA aneurysm: 9mm, z-score +12 (giant)\n- LAD aneurysm: 7mm, z-score +9 (large, approaching giant)\n\nCurrent therapy: Dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin + clopidogrel)\n\nAccording to AHA guidelines for Kawasaki disease, patients with giant aneurysms (z-score ≥10 or absolute dimension ≥8mm) are at highest risk for thrombosis and stenosis. The recommended antithrombotic therapy for giant aneurysms includes:\n\n- Dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin + clopidogrel) PLUS anticoagulation with warfarin (target INR 2.0-3.0) or low-molecular-weight heparin\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\nA. Addition of warfarin with target INR 2.0-3.0 - This aligns with guidelines for giant aneurysms, which recommend triple therapy (dual antiplatelet + anticoagulation) due to high thrombotic risk.\n\nB. Discontinuation of clopidogrel - This would be inappropriate; giant aneurysms require intensified, not reduced, antithrombotic therapy.\n\nC. Annual exercise stress testing only - While stress testing is part of surveillance, this doesn't address the need for additional antithrombotic therapy.\n\nD. Coronary CT angiography every 5 years - Surveillance imaging is needed, but guidelines typically recommend more frequent imaging (every 1-2 years) for giant aneurysms, and this doesn't address the therapeutic gap.\n\nE. Restriction from all competitive sports - While activity restrictions are recommended for patients with giant aneurysms (particularly contact sports due to bleeding risk on anticoagulation, and high-intensity activities), complete restriction from ALL competitive sports is not the primary intervention needed here.\n\nThe most critical missing intervention is anticoagulation. Giant coronary aneurysms have significant thrombotic risk, and current guidelines strongly recommend adding warfarin to dual antiplatelet therapy.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}]
