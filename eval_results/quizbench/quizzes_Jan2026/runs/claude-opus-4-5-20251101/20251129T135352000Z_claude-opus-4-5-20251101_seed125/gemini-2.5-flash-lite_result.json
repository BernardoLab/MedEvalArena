This condition is consistent with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) or a similar autosomal recessive B cell defect. The key observation is that his asymptomatic 2-year-old brother has the same mutation.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Residual maternal IgG providing passive immunity: While maternal IgG can provide passive immunity to infants, it typically wanes by 6-12 months of age. A 2-year-old would not be expected to have sufficient residual maternal IgG to completely prevent infections if they had a severe B cell defect.\n\nB. Somatic mosaicism with partial gene function restoration: Somatic mosaicism means that the mutation is present in some cells but not others, or that there are different levels of gene expression in different cells. If the brother had somatic mosaicism where a significant proportion of his cells had the wild-type allele or a functional protein, he could be asymptomatic. This is a plausible explanation for an asymptomatic individual with a mutation that causes severe disease in others.\n\nC. Compensatory upregulation of alternative signaling pathways: While the immune system can sometimes compensate for defects, a complete absence of CD19+ B cells and immunoglobulins suggests a fundamental block in B cell development that is unlikely to be overcome by compensatory pathways alone.\n\nD. X-chromosome inactivation favoring the wild-type allele: X-chromosome inactivation is a process that occurs in females to equalize gene dosage between males and females. This patient is a boy, so he has only one X chromosome. Therefore, X-chromosome inactivation is not relevant here.\n\nE. Presence of a hypomorphic rather than null mutation: A hypomorphic mutation is one that results in reduced but not completely absent protein function. If the mutation in the brother was hypomorphic, it might lead to a milder phenotype or a delayed onset of symptoms, but a complete absence of CD19+ B cells and immunoglobulins in the affected sibling suggests a more severe defect, possibly a null mutation or a severe loss-of-function mutation. If the brother had a hypomorphic mutation that allowed for some B cell development, he might be asymptomatic, but the description of the affected sibling points to a severe block. However, the question states \"same mutation,\" which could imply the same genetic change. If the mutation is truly the same, and it causes severe disease in one sibling, then a hypomorphic effect in the other would be a possibility if the mutation's severity is context-dependent or if there are other modifying factors. However, somatic mosaicism (option B) is a more direct explanation for an asymptomatic individual carrying a mutation that causes severe disease.\n\nConsidering the options, somatic mosaicism (B) provides the most direct and plausible explanation for an asymptomatic individual carrying a mutation that causes a severe B cell deficiency in their sibling. It implies that the brother has a population of cells that can compensate for the defective ones, allowing for normal immune function.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed125", "question_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed125-002", "question": "A 58-year-old woman with metastatic melanoma receiving combination ipilimumab and nivolumab develops acute onset confusion, fever to 39.2°C, and neck stiffness on day 21 of treatment.

Elevated CSF adenosine deaminase (ADA) level: Elevated ADA is a marker for tuberculous meningitis. While possible, it's not specific for irAEs and would point towards an infectious etiology.\n\nB. Presence of oligoclonal bands with matched serum bands: Oligoclonal bands in CSF, especially when matched by serum bands, are indicative of chronic inflammation and are commonly seen in multiple sclerosis. While immune-mediated, they are not a specific marker for irAE-induced aseptic meningitis.\n\nC. Markedly elevated CSF IL-17 levels: Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a role in various autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. Studies have shown elevated IL-17 in the CSF of patients with irAEs, including aseptic meningitis. This finding would support an immune-mediated process.\n\nD. CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio greater than 4:1 with activated phenotype: While T cell activation is central to irAEs, a specific CD4+/CD8+ ratio and activated phenotype are not as definitively established as a unique marker for irAE-induced aseptic meningitis compared to other inflammatory or infectious processes.

Genetic testing for SMN1 deletions is negative.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Infantile-onset Pompe disease: This is a lysosomal storage disorder that causes progressive muscle weakness and hypotonia. While it can present in infancy, the CSF protein is typically normal or only mildly elevated, and tongue fasciculations are not a characteristic feature. EMG findings can be consistent with a myopathy.\n\nB. Acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS): GBS is an autoimmune disorder that affects the peripheral nervous system. The AMAN variant primarily affects motor axons. It can present with rapid onset of weakness and hypotonia. Absent reflexes are expected. However, markedly elevated CSF protein is a hallmark of GBS (albuminocytologic dissociation), and tongue fasciculations are not typical. The history of a recent URI is a common trigger for GBS. EMG findings of reduced motor unit recruitment and fibrillation potentials are consistent with axonal damage.\n\nC. Spinal muscular atrophy type 1 (SMA type 1) with atypical genetics: SMA type 1 is characterized by severe hypotonia, weakness, and fasciculations, often with tongue fasciculations. However, the hallmark genetic finding is deletion or mutation of the SMN1 gene, which is reported as negative in this case. While atypical genetics for SMA exist, the negative SMN1 deletion makes this less likely as the primary diagnosis.\n\nD. Infantile botulism: This is caused by the toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum. It presents with descending paralysis, hypotonia, poor feeding, and constipation. Cranial nerve palsies are common, and reflexes are diminished or absent. However, tongue fasciculations are not a typical feature, and CSF protein is usually normal. EMG can show a characteristic pattern of reduced compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) with incremental response to repetitive nerve stimulation, but fibrillation potentials are not the primary finding.\n\nE. Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-associated polyradiculopathy: CMV infection can cause a polyradiculopathy, particularly in immunocompromised infants. This can lead to weakness, hypotonia, and sensory deficits. CSF protein is often elevated. However, tongue fasciculations are not a typical feature, and the presentation might be more subacute or chronic.\n\nRevisiting option B: The combination of rapid onset of hypotonia, absent reflexes, paradoxical breathing (suggesting diaphragmatic weakness), EMG findings of axonal damage, and markedly elevated CSF protein strongly points towards an acquired demyelinating or axonal neuropathy. The AMAN variant of GBS fits this picture well, especially with the preceding URI. While tongue fasciculations are not a classic GBS symptom, they can sometimes be seen in severe neuromuscular weakness. The markedly elevated CSF protein is a very strong indicator for GBS.\n\nConsidering the options and the clinical presentation, the AMAN variant of GBS is the most fitting diagnosis given the rapid onset, hypotonia, absent reflexes, EMG findings, and significantly elevated CSF protein, despite the presence of tongue fasciculations which are less typical but not entirely exclusionary in severe neuromuscular compromise.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed125", "question_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed125-004", "question": "A 45-year-old man with acute myeloid leukemia undergoes allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Let's analyze the options:\n\n*   **A. Elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase with schistocytes on peripheral smear:** Thrombotic microangiopathies, including TA-TMA, are characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, which leads to elevated LDH (due to hemolysis) and the presence of schistocytes (fragmented red blood cells) on a peripheral smear. This is a hallmark of microangiopathic processes.\n\n*   **B. Presence of hemosiderin-laden macrophages in BAL fluid:** Hemosiderin-laden macrophages in BAL fluid indicate chronic or recurrent bleeding into the alveoli. While DAH involves bleeding, this finding is not specific to TA-TMA and can be seen in other causes of DAH, including IPS.\n\n*   **C. Concurrent acute kidney injury with proteinuria:** Renal involvement, including AKI and proteinuria, can occur in thrombotic microangiopathies due to microvascular thrombi in the kidneys. However, AKI can also be a complication of severe illness, sepsis, or other transplant-related issues, and while suggestive, it's not as directly indicative of the microangiopathic process as schistocytes.\n\n*   **D. Elevated plasma-free hemoglobin with decreased haptoglobin:** These findings are indicative of intravascular hemolysis, which is a component of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. However, elevated LDH and schistocytes (option A) are more specific indicators of the *mechanism* of hemolysis in TMA.\n\n*   **E. Refractory thrombocytopenia despite platelet transfusions:** Thrombocytopenia is common after HSCT and can be seen in both TA-TMA and IPS. Refractory thrombocytopenia can be a feature of TA-TMA due to platelet consumption in microthrombi, but it's not as specific as the hematological findings of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia.\n\nConsidering the options, the presence of schistocytes on a peripheral smear, along with elevated LDH, is the most direct and specific indicator of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, which is a core feature of transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy.

The history of chickenpox is also relevant, as viral infections can trigger vasculitis.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Lifelong warfarin anticoagulation: While anticoagulation is used in some stroke etiologies, it's not the primary treatment for arterial stenosis unless there's an embolic source or a hypercoagulable state, neither of which is clearly present here. Warfarin also carries bleeding risks.\n\nB. Aspirin therapy for 2 years with serial vascular imaging: Aspirin is an antiplatelet agent that helps prevent clot formation. Given the arterial stenosis, reducing platelet aggregation is a reasonable strategy. Serial vascular imaging is important to monitor the stenosis and assess for improvement or progression. The duration of 2 years is a common recommendation for secondary stroke prevention in pediatric stroke.\n\nC. Immediate surgical bypass of the stenotic segment: Surgical bypass is a more invasive intervention and is typically reserved for severe, symptomatic stenosis that is not amenable to medical management or when there is a high risk of recurrent stroke. Given the \"beaded\" appearance, medical management is usually tried first.\n\nD. High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin monthly: IVIG is used for certain inflammatory or autoimmune conditions, including some forms of vasculitis. While vasculitis is a possibility, it's not the most direct or evidence-based first-line treatment for this specific presentation without a confirmed autoimmune diagnosis.\n\nE. Indefinite dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel: Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is generally reserved for specific situations like recent stent placement or acute coronary syndromes. For secondary stroke prevention in pediatric arterial stenosis, single antiplatelet therapy with aspirin is often the initial choice, and DAPT might be considered if there's a high risk of recurrent events or specific indications.\n\nConsidering the findings of focal stenosis with a beaded appearance, which suggests a vasculopathy or RCVS, and the absence of clear embolic sources or hypercoagulable states, antiplatelet therapy is the most appropriate initial long-term management.

The elevated blood pressure, visual changes, right upper quadrant pain, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT, LDH), and proteinuria are classic. The presence of schistocytes on peripheral smear further supports microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, a component of HELLP. The rising creatinine also indicates renal involvement.\n\nDespite delivery, her condition has worsened, with a further drop in platelets and rise in creatinine. The ADAMTS13 activity of 68% is within the normal range (typically >70%), which is crucial in differentiating HELLP syndrome from thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).

However, the patient's condition is not improving and is worsening post-delivery, suggesting a severe form of the disease or ongoing complications.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\nA. Initiate therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE): TPE is the mainstay of treatment for TTP and atypical HUS, where there is a deficiency in ADAMTS13 activity or complement dysregulation, respectively. Since the ADAMTS13 activity is normal, TPE is not indicated for this patient's HELLP syndrome.\n\nB. Administer eculizumab: Eculizumab is a complement inhibitor used in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). While some forms of severe preeclampsia can have complement activation, the normal ADAMTS13 activity and the classic HELLP presentation make aHUS less likely as the primary diagnosis. Eculizumab is not a standard treatment for HELLP syndrome.\n\nC. Begin rituximab infusion: Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody targeting CD20-positive B cells, used in various autoimmune conditions and some hematologic malignancies. It is not a standard treatment for HELLP syndrome.\n\nD. Transfuse platelets to maintain count above 50,000/μL: Platelet transfusions are generally reserved for patients with HELLP syndrome who are actively bleeding or undergoing invasive procedures. Prophylactic platelet transfusion to maintain a specific count is not routinely recommended in HELLP syndrome, especially when the platelet count is not critically low (e.g., <10,000-20,000/μL) and there is no active bleeding. The current count of 28,000/μL, while low, does not automatically warrant transfusion without evidence of bleeding.\n\nE. Continue supportive care with expectant management: Given that delivery has occurred and the patient is receiving appropriate medical management for severe preeclampsia (magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis and labetalol for blood pressure control), continued supportive care is the most appropriate next step.

Levetiracetam:** Levetiracetam is generally considered effective and well-tolerated for generalized epilepsies, including JME. It is not typically contraindicated.\n*   **B. Valproic acid:** Valproic acid is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug that is highly effective for generalized epilepsies, including JME. It is often a first-line treatment.\n*   **C.

The central venous oxygen saturation is low (58%), and lactate is elevated (6.2 mmol/L), indicating tissue hypoperfusion. The cardiac index is also low (2.0 L/min/m²). The echocardiogram shows a hyperdynamic left ventricle with a preserved ejection fraction and small, underfilled chambers, suggesting that the low cardiac output is not due to systolic dysfunction but rather to preload deficiency or impaired diastolic filling.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Add dobutamine for inotropic support: Dobutamine is an inotrope that increases contractility and heart rate. While the patient has a hyperdynamic LV, the primary issue appears to be low cardiac output and underfilled chambers, suggesting a preload problem or impaired filling rather than a primary contractility issue. Adding an inotrope might not address the root cause and could potentially worsen myocardial oxygen demand if preload is not optimized.\n\nB. Administer additional crystalloid bolus: The echocardiogram showing small, underfilled chambers strongly suggests that the patient is still hypovolemic or has inadequate preload. Despite initial fluid resuscitation, the persistent hypotension and low cardiac index, coupled with the echocardiographic findings, indicate that further fluid administration is warranted to improve ventricular filling and thus cardiac output.\n\nC. Initiate phenylephrine infusion: Phenylephrine is a pure alpha-1 agonist, causing vasoconstriction. While it can increase blood pressure, it does so by increasing systemic vascular resistance without significantly affecting cardiac output. In a patient with a low cardiac index and signs of hypoperfusion, increasing SVR without improving cardiac output could worsen tissue perfusion.\n\nD. Add epinephrine as third vasopressor: Epinephrine has both alpha and beta-adrenergic effects. While it can increase both heart rate and contractility (beta effects) and cause vasoconstriction (alpha effects), it is generally considered a second-line agent when other vasopressors are insufficient. Given the echocardiographic findings pointing towards preload issues, adding another vasopressor without addressing preload might not be the most appropriate next step.\n\nE. Begin hydrocortisone 50 mg IV every 6 hours: Corticosteroids are indicated in septic shock refractory to fluid resuscitation and vasopressors. However, the patient has only been on norepinephrine and vasopressin for an unspecified duration, and the echocardiogram provides a crucial clue about the underlying hemodynamics. While hydrocortisone might be considered later if the shock remains refractory, addressing the apparent preload deficit is a more immediate and targeted intervention based on the provided information.\n\nConsidering the echocardiographic findings of small, underfilled chambers, the most appropriate next intervention is to optimize preload.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed125", "question_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed125-010", "question": "A 7-year-old boy presents with 2 weeks of progressive gait instability and tremor.

The paraneoplastic syndrome is associated with neuroblastoma, particularly in children. The clinical presentation of gait instability, tremor, opsoclonus, myoclonus, and truncal ataxia, along with elevated urine catecholamines and a paraspinal mass, strongly suggests neuroblastoma as the underlying cause.\n\nWe need to identify the factor that indicates the worst long-term neurodevelopmental prognosis despite tumor treatment. Let's analyze the options:\n\nA. Presence of anti-Hu antibodies in serum: Anti-Hu antibodies are typically associated with paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis in adults, often linked to small cell lung cancer. While paraneoplastic syndromes can involve antibodies, anti-Hu is not the primary antibody associated with OMS in children. Even if present, it's not the most definitive indicator of the worst prognosis in this specific context.\n\nB. CSF oligoclonal bands with elevated IgG index: These findings suggest chronic inflammation within the central nervous system, which can be seen in various neurological conditions, including some paraneoplastic syndromes. However, they are not as directly linked to the severity of neurodevelopmental outcome in OMS as other factors.\n\nC. Age less than 3 years at symptom onset: Younger age at onset of OMS is a well-established risk factor for poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes. Children diagnosed and treated at a younger age have a longer period of brain development that can be affected by the paraneoplastic process and its treatment. This is a significant predictor of worse long-term prognosis.\n\nD. Tumor histology showing neuroblastoma with MYCN amplification: MYCN amplification in neuroblastoma is associated with a higher risk of relapse and poorer overall survival for the tumor itself. However, the question asks about neurodevelopmental prognosis *despite tumor treatment*. While aggressive tumor biology can indirectly impact neurodevelopment, the direct impact of age at onset on the developing brain is often more profound for neurodevelopmental outcomes.\n\nE. Delayed initiation of immunotherapy beyond 4 weeks from diagnosis: Immunotherapy (e.g., steroids, IVIg) is a crucial part of managing the paraneoplastic syndrome. Delaying treatment can lead to more prolonged neurological damage. However, the question implies that tumor treatment is planned, and the focus is on factors that indicate the worst prognosis *despite* treatment. While delay is detrimental, age at onset is a more fundamental prognostic factor for long-term neurodevelopment.\n\nConsidering the options, younger age at symptom onset (less than 3 years) is a consistently reported factor associated with a worse long-term neurodevelopmental outcome in children with OMS. This is because the developing brain is more vulnerable to the effects of the paraneoplastic process and its sequelae.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$."}]
