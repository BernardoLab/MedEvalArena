Younger age at onset (particularly <3 years) is paradoxically associated with worse long-term cognitive and behavioral outcomes, likely due to the impact of neuroinflammation on the developing brain during critical periods. While MYCN amplification indicates aggressive tumor biology, it does not correlate with neurological outcomes. Anti-Hu antibodies are rare in pediatric OMS. CSF inflammatory markers and treatment delays affect outcomes but age remains the strongest predictor of neurodevelopmental sequelae.", "generator_model": "claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "seed": 125, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "pred": "C", "model_outputs": "The clinical scenario describes opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome (OMS), which is strongly associated with neuroblastoma in children.  \n\nKey points:  \n- OMS is often a paraneoplastic syndrome in this age group.  \n- Even after successful tumor resection, many children have significant long-term neurodevelopmental deficits.  \n- Factors associated with worse neurodevelopmental outcome include **younger age at onset** (especially < 3 years), delayed treatment of OMS with immunotherapy, and possibly certain tumor characteristics, but the **strongest and most consistent predictor** in studies is **young age at onset**.  \n\nAmong the options:  \n- **A (anti-Hu antibodies)** – More associated with paraneoplastic syndromes in adults (e.g., small cell lung cancer) and severe neurological deficits, but less specific for neuroblastoma-related OMS prognosis.  \n- **B (CSF oligoclonal bands)** – Common in OMS, indicates intrathecal inflammation, but not the strongest prognostic factor for worst long-term outcome.  \n- **C (Age less than 3 years at symptom onset)** – Well-established in literature as predicting worse cognitive outcome despite tumor treatment.  \n- **D (MYCN amplification)** – Indicates worse oncologic prognosis for neuroblastoma, but not specifically the strongest predictor of neurodevelopmental outcome in OMS independent of tumor treatment.  \n- **E (Delayed immunotherapy)** – Also important, but the question asks for the finding that would indicate the worst long-term neurodevelopmental prognosis; age < 3 years is consistently cited as the major risk factor.  \n\nGiven the emphasis on **long-term neurodevelopmental prognosis** in OMS, the single best answer is **age less than 3 years at symptom onset**.  \n\nThe answer is (C)"}]
