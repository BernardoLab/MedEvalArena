Males who inherit the mutation are hemizygous and typically manifest the severe phenotype (complete lack of B cells and immunoglobulins). The 2-year-old brother, being male, inherited the same X-linked mutation. However, he is asymptomatic.\n\nWe must explain why a male with a genetic mutation for a severe immunodeficiency is asymptomatic.\n\nA. Residual maternal IgG: Maternal IgG is transferred across the placenta but has a half-life of about 3-4 weeks. It provides protection only for the first 6-9 months of life. A 2-year-old would no longer have protective levels of maternal antibodies.\n\nB. Somatic mosaicism with partial gene function restoration: This phenomenon, known as revertant somatic mosaicism, has been described in several genetic immunodeficiencies, including Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and XLA. It occurs when a spontaneous \"reverse\" mutation arises in a hematopoietic stem cell or progenitor cell, correcting the original genetic defect. In XLA, BTK is essential for B-cell development. Pre-B cells with the mutation die in the bone marrow. However, if a progenitor cell undergoes a reversion event that restores functional BTK (even partial function), that cell and its progeny gain a tremendous selective survival advantage and can mature into functional B cells. These B cells can populate the periphery and produce immunoglobulins, rendering the patient asymptomatic or resulting in a much milder phenotype. Genetic testing performed on whole blood (which usually analyzes DNA from granulocytes or T cells where the mutation is still present and no selection occurs) would still detect the inherited mutation, but the patient would have functional B cells.\n\nC. Compensatory upregulation: BTK is a critical checkpoint molecule in B-cell receptor signaling. There is no known compensatory pathway that can fully substitute for BTK function to allow normal B-cell development in the presence of a null mutation.\n\nD. X-chromosome inactivation: Lyonization (X-inactivation) occurs in females (who have two X chromosomes) to balance gene dosage. Males have only one X chromosome; therefore, X-inactivation does not occur.\n\nE. Hypomorphic mutation: While hypomorphic (partial loss of function) mutations in BTK can cause milder disease, the older brother has the \"classic\" severe phenotype with absent B cells. Since both brothers have the *same* mutation, it is acting as a null mutation in the older brother. It is highly unlikely to act as a hypomorph in the younger brother to the extent of him being asymptomatic without another mechanism like mosaicism.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation for the brother's lack of symptoms despite having the mutation is the presence of a cell line that has corrected the genetic defect (revertant somatic mosaicism), allowing for B-cell development.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed125", "question_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed125-002", "question": "A 58-year-old woman with metastatic melanoma receiving combination ipilimumab and nivolumab develops acute onset confusion, fever to 39.2°C, and neck stiffness on day 21 of treatment.

Infectious Etiologies:\n    *   Viral meningitis typically presents with *normal* CSF glucose and a predominance of CD8+ T cells (CD4/CD8 ratio < 1).\n    *   Tuberculous meningitis presents with low glucose and high protein, but is classically associated with elevated Adenosine Deaminase (ADA).

The presence of tongue fasciculations and paradoxical breathing are classic signs of anterior horn cell disease like SMA. However, the genetic testing for SMN1 deletions is negative, ruling out the most common form of SMA.\n\nKey distinguishing features in this case are:\n1.  History: The onset follows a recent upper respiratory infection, and the course is subacute (progressive over 2 weeks), which is characteristic of an autoimmune post-infectious etiology like GBS.\n2.  CSF Findings: The cerebrospinal fluid protein is markedly elevated (280 mg/dL). In SMA and Botulism, CSF protein is typically normal. Such a high protein level without mention of pleocytosis (albuminocytologic dissociation) is the hallmark of GBS.\n3.  EMG Findings: Fibrillation potentials and reduced motor unit recruitment indicate an acute denervating process (neuropathic/axonal). While classic GBS (AIDP) is demyelinating, the Acute Motor Axonal Neuropathy (AMAN) variant is characterized by axonal damage, leading to early denervation potentials (fibrillations) on EMG. AMAN is well-recognized in children and can mimic SMA due to the profound, pure motor axonal involvement.\n4.  Tongue Fasciculations: While classically associated with SMA, tongue fasciculations can occur in GBS (specifically AMAN) due to denervation of the tongue musculature from hypoglossal nerve involvement.\n5.  Exclusions:\n    *   Infantile-onset Pompe disease (A): This is a myopathy. EMG would show myopathic units (small amplitude, early recruitment) and myotonic-like discharges, not reduced recruitment.\n    *   SMA Type 1 (C): Ruled out by genetic testing and the high CSF protein.\n    *   Infantile Botulism (D): CSF protein is normal. EMG would show presynaptic defects (facilitation on repetitive stimulation).\n    *   CMV-associated polyradiculopathy (E): In the context of \"polyradiculopathy\" specifically caused by CMV (often in immunocompromised states), CSF typically shows a polymorphonuclear pleocytosis, distinct from the albuminocytologic dissociation seen here. CMV can trigger GBS, but the syndrome described fits the AMAN pattern of GBS best.\n\nTherefore, the patient has the AMAN variant of GBS, which can mimic SMA clinically but is differentiated by the post-infectious history and high CSF protein.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed125", "question_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed125-004", "question": "A 45-year-old man with acute myeloid leukemia undergoes allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Clinical Picture: The patient is at day +14 post-transplant (peri-engraftment period) presenting with classical signs of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH)—fever, hypoxemia, diffuse infiltrates, and progressively bloody BAL return. Infectious workup is negative.\n2.  Differential Diagnosis:\n    *   Idiopathic Pneumonia Syndrome (IPS): A diagnosis of exclusion characterized by diffuse lung injury and non-infectious inflammation. While it can cause DAH, it is not associated with systemic microangiopathic hemolytic anemia.\n    *   Transplant-Associated Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TA-TMA): A syndrome of endothelial injury (often triggered by calcineurin inhibitors like tacrolimus, viral infections, or GVHD). It causes systemic thrombotic microangiopathy leading to end-organ damage.\n3.  Evaluating the Options:\n    *   A. Elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) with schistocytes on peripheral smear: TA-TMA is defined by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA). The hallmark morphologic finding of MAHA is the presence of schistocytes (fragmented red blood cells) on the peripheral smear, resulting from mechanical shearing in the microvasculature. Elevated LDH is a marker of this hemolysis and tissue injury. IPS does not cause microangiopathic hemolysis. Therefore, the presence of schistocytes is the most specific finding distinguishing TA-TMA from IPS.\n    *   B. Hemosiderin-laden macrophages: This finding confirms alveolar hemorrhage has been present for at least 48-72 hours. It helps diagnose DAH but does not determine the etiology (it would be seen in DAH from both IPS and TMA if the bleeding wasn't hyperacute).\n    *   C. Concurrent acute kidney injury with proteinuria: Renal involvement is a major feature of TA-TMA. However, acute kidney injury (AKI) is very common in HSCT patients due to nephrotoxic drugs, sepsis, or hypovolemia. While proteinuria suggests glomerular injury (consistent with TMA), AKI alone is less specific for TMA than the hematologic markers of microangiopathy in the context of distinguishing it from IPS.\n    *   D. Elevated plasma-free hemoglobin with decreased haptoglobin: These are markers of intravascular hemolysis. While consistent with TMA, they characterize hemolysis in general. Schistocytes (Option A) provide the specific morphologic evidence of the *microangiopathic* mechanism required for the diagnosis of TMA.\n    *   E. Refractory thrombocytopenia: Thrombocytopenia is a criterion for TA-TMA (\"consumption\"), but it is extremely non-specific in the early post-transplant period (Day +14) due to poor marrow function/engraftment kinetics.\n\nConclusion: The presence of schistocytes on a peripheral smear in the setting of organ dysfunction (DAH) is the strongest support for a diagnosis of thrombotic microangiopathy, as it demonstrates the specific pathophysiology (microangiopathic hemolysis) which is absent in Idiopathic Pneumonia Syndrome.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed125", "question_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed125-005", "question": "A 3-year-old girl presents with acute onset right-sided weakness and slurred speech.

Diagnosis: The patient is a young child (3 years old) with an arterial ischemic stroke. The classic risk factor present is a varicella infection (chickenpox) occurring weeks to months prior (6 weeks in this case). The angiographic findings of focal stenosis in the distal internal carotid artery (often extending to the proximal MCA or ACA) with an irregular or \"beaded\" appearance are characteristic of this inflammatory arteriopathy. Unlike Moyamoya disease, TCA/PVA is typically unilateral and monophasic.\n\n2.  Management: The primary goal is secondary stroke prevention.\n    *   Antithrombotic Therapy: Current guidelines (e.g., American College of Chest Physicians, American Heart Association) recommend antithrombotic therapy for children with arterial ischemic stroke. For non-cardioembolic and non-dissection causes (like TCA/FCA), aspirin is generally the first-line agent for long-term management.\n    *   Duration: Because TCA is often a monophasic transient condition (though it can worsen initially before stabilizing), therapy is usually continued for a specific period to cover the window of recurrence and allow for vascular stabilization. A duration of 2 years is commonly cited in guidelines (e.g., CHEST 2012) for non-progressive arteriopathies.\n    *   Monitoring: Serial vascular imaging (MRA or CTA) is crucial to differentiate TCA from progressive arteriopathies like Moyamoya disease. If the stenosis stabilizes or resolves, the diagnosis of TCA is confirmed. If it progresses or becomes bilateral, the diagnosis and management (e.g., potential surgery) change.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n*   A: Lifelong warfarin is reserved for high-risk recurrent conditions like severe thrombophilias or cardioembolic sources (e.g., mechanical valves). It carries a high bleeding risk and requires monitoring, which is not indicated for a transient inflammatory arteriopathy.\n*   C: Surgical bypass (e.g., pial synangiosis) is the treatment for Moyamoya disease, which is a progressive, typically bilateral steno-occlusive disease with collateral formation.

The key to answering this question lies in interpreting the echocardiographic findings in the context of the hemodynamic data.\n\n1.  Hemodynamic Profile: Use of norepinephrine and vasopressin indicates vasoplegia. However, the Cardiac Index is low (2.0 L/min/m²), and ScvO2 is low (58%), which suggests low cardiac output is contributing to the shock state (delivery limited oxygen consumption).\n2.  Echocardiogram Findings: The presence of a \"hyperdynamic left ventricle with LVEF 70%\" combined with \"small, underfilled chambers\" is the classic echocardiographic presentation of hypovolemia.\n3.  Pathophysiology: Severe necrotizing pancreatitis causes profound systemic inflammation and capillary leak, leading to massive third-spacing of fluids. While the prompt states the patient received \"adequate fluid resuscitation\" (likely referring to initial standard boluses, e.g., 30 mL/kg), the objective data from the echocardiogram demonstrates that the patient is currently intravascularly volume depleted.\n4.  Management:\n    *   A (Dobutamine): Dobutamine is an inotrope indicated for septic cardiomyopathy (low EF, low CO). This patient has a hyperdynamic heart (high EF). Adding an inotrope to an empty, hyperdynamic heart can increase oxygen demand, cause arrhythmias, or precipitate dynamic outflow tract obstruction without improving stroke volume.\n    *   B (Additional crystalloid bolus): The echo confirms that the cause of the low cardiac output is insufficient preload (\"underfilled chambers\"). The correct physiological intervention is to replenish intravascular volume to allow the Starling curve to increase stroke volume and cardiac output.\n    *   C, D, E: While steroids (E) are used in refractory septic shock, and additional vasopressors (C, D) might be considered if the patient were volume-replete, the primary actionable finding is hypovolemia.

CSF inflammatory markers and treatment delays affect outcomes but age remains the strongest predictor of neurodevelopmental sequelae.", "generator_model": "claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "seed": 125, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "pred": "A", "model_outputs": "This patient presents with opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome (OMAS), a rare paraneoplastic syndrome most commonly associated with neuroblastoma in children. The clinical presentation of chaotic eye movements (opsoclonus), myoclonus, and ataxia is characteristic. A paraspinal mass and elevated catecholamines confirm the diagnosis of neuroblastoma.\n\nThis question asks for the finding that indicates the WORST long-term neurodevelopmental prognosis.\n\n1.  Anti-Hu antibodies (Option A): While rare in pediatric OMAS (most cases are seronegative or have unidentified antibodies), the presence of anti-Hu (ANNA-1) antibodies is a well-established marker for a poor neurological prognosis in paraneoplastic syndromes. Anti-Hu antibodies are associated with cytotoxic T-cell-mediated neuronal destruction (paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis/sensory neuronopathy) which entails irreversible neuronal damage. In contrast, the typical seronegative OMAS mechanism (likely involving surface antibodies or B-cell dysfunction) is more amenable to immunotherapy, though sequelae are common. If anti-Hu antibodies are found, the likelihood of severe, refractory neurological disability is significantly higher.\n\n2.  CSF oligoclonal bands (Option B): Oligoclonal bands and an elevated IgG index are frequently found in OMAS (indicating intrathecal inflammation) but do not consistently predict a worse long-term outcome compared to other factors.\n\n3.  Age less than 3 years (Option C): Literature suggests that younger age at onset (particularly infants) corresponds to worse cognitive and language outcomes due to the disruption of critical brain development periods. However, the patient described is a 7-year-old boy presenting with a 2-week history. Therefore, the finding of \"Age less than 3 years at symptom onset\" is factually impossible for this patient. Even as a general principle, while younger age is a risk, the anti-Hu mechanism represents a more destructive pathology.\n\n4.  Tumor histology (Option D): OMAS is typically associated with biologically favorable neuroblastoma (low stage, non-amplified MYCN). While MYCN amplification would predict a poor *oncological* survival (high-risk tumor), the prompt asks about the *neurodevelopmental* prognosis \"despite tumor treatment.\" The neurological severity of OMAS does not strictly correlate with the tumor's malignancy; in fact, the immune response in OMAS may help contain the tumor. The primary driver of poor neuro-outcome is the paraneoplastic injury, not the tumor biology itself.\n\n5.  Delayed initiation of immunotherapy (Option E): Delay in treatment (e.g., waiting months for diagnosis or tumor resection without immunotherapy) is a major modifiable risk factor for poor outcomes. However, the vignette states the patient has only had symptoms for 2 weeks, which is a very early presentation. \"Delayed initiation\" describes a management error or a future event, rather than an \"additional finding\" present at diagnosis. Furthermore, the destructive potential of an anti-Hu positive syndrome (Option A) is inherently worse and less responsive than typical OMAS, even if the latter is delayed slightly.\n\nTherefore, the detection of anti-Hu antibodies represents a pathophysiology associated with essentially permanent and severe neuronal loss, indicating the worst prognosis among the plausible findings.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}]
