Verdict: Correct best answer. The question identifies the critical safety factor for T-DXd rechallenge after drug-induced ILD. Key discriminating findings: confirmed T-DXd-induced ILD with lymphocytic pattern, complete resolution after drug cessation, and current disease progression creating therapeutic need. Current expert consensus identifies Grade 1 ILD with complete radiographic resolution as the sole scenario where rechallenge may be considered; Grade 2-4 are absolute contraindications. Option A correctly captures this risk stratification principle. Alternative options are clearly inferior: anti-drug antibodies (B) and skin testing (D) are irrelevant to payload-related toxicity; HER2 amplification (C) addresses efficacy not safety; baseline PFTs (E) are monitoring parameters, not predictive factors.
