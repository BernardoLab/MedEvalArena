The stem describes a patient with \"progressive dyspnea\" attributed to drug-induced ILD. By definition (CTCAE), symptomatic ILD is Grade ≥2. Current FDA labeling and clinical guidelines for trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) mandate permanent discontinuation for Grade ≥2 ILD; rechallenge is absolutely contraindicated. Rechallenge is only permissible for Grade 1 (asymptomatic, radiographic only) ILD after resolution. \n\nKeyed Option A states the \"Initial ILD grade was 1,\" which directly contradicts the clinical presentation of dyspnea in the stem. A patient cannot have Grade 1 ILD and be dyspneic simultaneously. Therefore, for the patient described (Grade 2), no option supports rechallenge.
