In-situ reconstruction with cryopreserved aortic allograft provides the best combination of infection resistance and durability, with lower reinfection rates (5-10%) compared to prosthetic grafts (20-30%) and better long-term patency than extra-anatomic bypass. Extra-anatomic bypass has high rates of aortic stump blowout and graft thrombosis. Endovascular repair alone does not address the infected field and has high failure rates for AEF. Rifampin-soaked Dacron has higher reinfection rates than allograft in this contaminated setting. The duodenum must also be repaired or resected with the definitive procedure.", "generator_model": "claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "seed": 129, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "target_topic": "Vascular Surgery", "judge_model": "claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "judge_model_outputs_raw": "{\"analysis\":\"Validity label: V.
