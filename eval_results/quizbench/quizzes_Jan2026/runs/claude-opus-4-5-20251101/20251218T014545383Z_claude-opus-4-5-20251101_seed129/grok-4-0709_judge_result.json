Upper endoscopy reveals a pulsatile mass eroding into the third portion of the duodenum with adherent clot. CT angiography confirms an aortoenteric fistula at the proximal anastomosis with a 4 cm pseudoaneurysm. He is hemodynamically stabilized with transfusion. Which definitive management strategy offers the BEST balance of durability and survival?", "options": ["Endovascular aortic stent graft placement with duodenal repair", "Extra-anatomic axillobifemoral bypass with graft excision and aortic stump closure", "In-situ reconstruction with cryopreserved aortic allograft after graft excision", "In-situ reconstruction with rifampin-soaked Dacron graft and omental wrap", "Endovascular stent graft as bridge to delayed open reconstruction"], "answer": "C", "answer_index": 2, "explanation": "Aortoenteric fistula (AEF) is a life-threatening complication requiring definitive surgical management. In-situ reconstruction with cryopreserved aortic allograft provides the best combination of infection resistance and durability, with lower reinfection rates (5-10%) compared to prosthetic grafts (20-30%) and better long-term patency than extra-anatomic bypass. Extra-anatomic bypass has high rates of aortic stump blowout and graft thrombosis. Endovascular repair alone does not address the infected field and has high failure rates for AEF. Rifampin-soaked Dacron has higher reinfection rates than allograft in this contaminated setting. The duodenum must also be repaired or resected with the definitive procedure.", "generator_model": "claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "seed": 129, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "target_topic": "Vascular Surgery", "judge_model": "grok-4-0709", "judge_model_outputs_raw": "{\n  \"analysis\": \"Validity label: V\\nVerdict on keyed answer: Correct best\\nKey stem clues that drive a unique best answer: History of prior AAA repair, melena with anemia (Hb 6.8 g/dL), endoscopy showing pulsatile mass eroding into duodenum with clot, CTA confirming aortoenteric fistula (AEF) with 4 cm pseudoaneurysm at proximal anastomosis, hemodynamically stabilized.
