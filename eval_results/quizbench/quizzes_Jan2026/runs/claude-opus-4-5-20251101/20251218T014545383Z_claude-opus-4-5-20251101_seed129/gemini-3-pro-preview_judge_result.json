The stem describes a patient with a word recognition score (WRS) of 48%. According to standard AAO-HNS guidelines, serviceable hearing is defined as a WRS >50% (and PTA <50 dB). Therefore, the patient currently has non-serviceable hearing, making the question's goal to 'preserve serviceable hearing' impossible. Furthermore, for a 2.8 cm vestibular schwannoma with brainstem compression and poor hearing, the standard of care is typically microsurgical resection (often Translabyrinthine, Option A) to relieve compression and prioritize facial nerve safety, as hearing is already lost. Radiotherapy (Options D/E) for a tumor of this size with brainstem compression carries significant risks of post-treatment expansion and acute worsening of compression. The keyed answer (E) relies on the incorrect premise that the hearing is serviceable and that radiation is the best primary management for a large compressive lesion.
