Verdict on keyed answer: Correct best. The clinical problem is selecting the most appropriate vasopressor strategy in refractory septic shock despite norepinephrine and fluids. Key stem clues: 72-year-old with septic shock from pneumonia, adequate fluid resuscitation, norepinephrine at 0.5 mcg/kg/min, MAP 58 mmHg, hyperdynamic LV with EF 75%, small LV cavity, IVC 0.8 cm with >50% variation, lactate 6.2 mmol/L—these indicate vasodilatory shock with possible exhausted fluid responsiveness, driving need for adjunct vasopressor. Most likely next step: Add vasopressin per guidelines for norepinephrine-refractory cases. Keyed answer A fits as SSC recommends vasopressin (0.03 units/min) as second-line to achieve MAP, supported by VASST trial benefits in less severe shock; assumes IVC findings confirm no further fluid benefit despite variation suggesting potential responsiveness, but stem states 'adequate' resuscitation. Alternatives: B (epinephrine) adds inotropy unnecessarily in hyperdynamic state; C (phenylephrine) risks reduced cardiac output; D (angiotensin II) for highly refractory cases after multiple agents; E delays adjunct by maxing norepinephrine, contrary to guidelines favoring early vasopressin addition.
