The immediate threat is the hemorrhagic stroke with mass effect and severe hypertension, not the CVT. The most appropriate immediate management is stabilization of the mother's neurologic and hypertensive emergency (E: Magnesium sulfate and antihypertensives), with delivery and anticoagulation as subsequent, coordinated steps. Option A (emergent cesarean delivery followed by anticoagulation) inappropriately prioritizes delivery over acute stroke and blood pressure management, which is a dangerous sequence.
