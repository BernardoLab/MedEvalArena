The stem describes a large parastomal hernia with significant prolapse, a scenario often considered a complex or recurrent hernia. For such cases, especially with a colostomy (contaminated field), current surgical guidelines and evidence favor a laparoscopic modified Sugarbaker repair with a composite mesh (e.g., ePTFE/polypropylene) as a standard of care, as it provides a barrier to visceral contact and reduces adhesion and erosion risk. The keyed answer (B: Open Sugarbaker with lightweight polypropylene) is suboptimal because an open approach in a contaminated field increases infection risk versus laparoscopic, and lightweight polypropylene alone is not ideal for direct visceral contact. Option C (Laparoscopic modified Sugarbaker with dual-layer composite mesh) is the most defensible best answer based on current evidence.

The vignette describes a penile trauma with blood at the meatus and retrograde urethrogram showing extravasation at the bulbar urethra without contrast reaching the bladder. This is a classic presentation of a complete (or near-complete) bulbar urethral injury, often associated with a straddle injury or penile fracture. For a complete bulbar urethral disruption, the definitive surgical management in the acute setting (within 48 hours) is typically immediate surgical exploration and primary realignment or anastomosis if possible, often via a perineal approach, not a penile incision. Option A describes immediate exploration via a circumferential subcoronal incision (a penile degloving approach suitable for penile fracture or pendulous urethral injuries) with primary urethral anastomosis. Option D describes immediate exploration with urethral repair over a catheter without anastomosis, which is less definitive for a complete disruption. Standard teaching for a complete bulbar urethral disruption is primary realignment or anastomosis when feasible, making A a strong contender. Option C (suprapubic catheter) is for delayed management. Option B is for delayed reconstruction. Option E (endoscopic realignment) is an alternative but may not address associated corporal injuries. The keyed answer D is not the most defensible best answer; A is more aligned with guidelines for acute complete bulbar urethral injury.

Key stem clues: left hemiplegia post-stroke, severe shoulder pain, 2 cm inferior subluxation, EMG shows spastic co-contraction of posterior deltoid and supraspinatus without voluntary recruitment. The question asks for optimal botulinum toxin injection protocol for this scenario. Main logical issue: The keyed answer (A) targets the posterior deltoid and supraspinatus, which are co-contracting per EMG. However, in post-stroke shoulder pain with subluxation, the typical spastic pattern involves hypertonicity of internal rotators/adductors (e.g., subscapularis, pectoralis major) and weakness of external rotators/abductors (e.g., supraspinatus, deltoid). Injecting the supraspinatus, a weakened abductor, could worsen subluxation. The EMG finding of co-contraction in posterior deltoid and supraspinatus is atypical; these muscles are usually underactive/weak. A more standard approach targets spastic internal rotators. Option B targets subscapularis and pectoralis major, which aligns with common practice to reduce subluxation and pain, though the dose (200 units onabotulinumtoxinA) may be high. Thus, a unique best answer is not clearly A; B is defensible based on standard spasticity patterns. Main medical accuracy issue: The EMG finding contradicts typical pathophysiology; co-contraction of posterior deltoid and supraspinatus is not the usual cause of subluxation.

The stem describes a complex fracture pattern in an elderly patient, where both reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) and hemiarthroplasty are standard considerations. The keyed answer (D) advocates RSA with standard baseplate and tuberosity preservation. However, option C (RSA with augmented baseplate) is also highly defensible given the 2 cm medial calcar comminution, which may indicate metaphyseal bone loss potentially warranting augmentation for stability. The rationale dismisses augmentation 'without glenoid bone loss,' but the comminution is humeral, not glenoid. This creates ambiguity.

This approach allows complete excision of the diverticulum sac, removal of stones, and multilayer closure to prevent recurrence and fistula. Marsupialization (option C) is a historical procedure for distal diverticula and is not recommended for proximal lesions due to high recurrence risk and potential incontinence.

Key stem clues: deep partial-thickness burns, early cicatricial ectropion, 3 mm scleral show, intact but contracted tarsal plate. The clinical scenario describes an acute burn with evolving cicatricial changes, not a mature, stable contracture. Standard reconstructive principles dictate delaying definitive reconstruction (e.g., full-thickness skin graft) until scar maturation is complete, typically 6-12 months post-injury, to prevent graft failure and recurrence. However, the stem specifies 'early' ectropion, implying active inflammation, which contradicts the key's technique of 'tarsal release'—a procedure for mature, fixed contracture, not an early, evolving one. This internal contradiction between the timing descriptor ('early') and the definitive surgical step ('release') undermines the key. Option B (delayed split-thickness graft with Frost suture) is a more defensible best answer for temporary protection of the globe during the inflammatory phase while awaiting definitive reconstruction. Main medical accuracy issue: The key advocates a definitive release procedure in an 'early' inflammatory setting, which is non-standard and risks graft failure.

The stem describes a Chiari I malformation with holocord syringomyelia undergoing posterior fossa decompression. The key discriminating finding is persistent syrinx with tonsillar pulsation after bone removal, indicating inadequate CSF flow restoration. The most likely next step, per standard neurosurgical practice, is to proceed with duraplasty (to expand the subarachnoid space) and often tonsillar reduction/coagulation (not necessarily full tonsillectomy) to ensure CSF flow. Option A (duraplasty with bovine pericardial graft and tonsillectomy) is a definitive, commonly performed procedure in this scenario. Option B (duraplasty with autologous pericranial graft without tonsillectomy) is less aggressive; while autologous graft may reduce pseudomeningocele risk, avoiding tonsillectomy may not adequately address persistent obstruction from impacted tonsils. The keyed answer (B) is not the single best answer; A is equally or more defensible based on standard management. The item is underspecified regarding the degree of tonsillar obstruction, leading to multiple defensible answers (secondary label: M).
