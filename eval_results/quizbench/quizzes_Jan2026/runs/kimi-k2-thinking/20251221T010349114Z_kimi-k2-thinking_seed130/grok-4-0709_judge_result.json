Key stem clues: 78-year-old patient with four-part proximal humerus fracture, head-split pattern, 2 cm medial calcar comminution, and fractured but non-displaced greater tuberosity, driving selection of optimal implant for elderly with complex fracture. These findings imply poor bone quality, high risk of fixation failure, and potential rotator cuff involvement, favoring arthroplasty over fixation or nonoperative care. Main logical issue(s): None; stem provides sufficient details to discriminate a unique best answer without contradictions or underspecification, as options are distinct and comparable. Main medical accuracy issue(s): Consistent with current orthopedic consensus (e.g., AAOS guidelines); reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) is preferred for head-split fractures in elderly due to superior outcomes in forward elevation and stability compared to ORIF (high failure rate ~60% in comminuted patterns) or hemiarthroplasty (requires intact rotator cuff). Tuberosity preservation in RTSA avoids stiffness from repair, and standard baseplate suffices without specified glenoid bone loss.
