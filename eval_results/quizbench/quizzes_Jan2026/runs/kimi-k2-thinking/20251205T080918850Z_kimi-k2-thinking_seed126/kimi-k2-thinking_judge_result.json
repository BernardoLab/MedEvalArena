Key stem clues: 76‑year‑old man with wild‑type transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRwt), LV wall thickness 16 mm, LVEF 45%—a classic infiltrative cardiomyopathy phenotype that must be distinguished from hypertensive heart disease. The question asks for a speckle‑tracking echocardiographic feature that best differentiates the two. The relative apical sparing ratio >1.5 (average apical strain divided by average basal strain) is a well‑validated, highly specific (≈93%) marker of cardiac amyloidosis, reflecting the base‑to‑apex gradient of amyloid deposition. In contrast, hypertensive LVH shows homogeneous reduction of longitudinal strain without apical sparing. Options A, C, D, and E are either nonspecific, describe incorrect patterns, or use thresholds that do not discriminate amyloidosis from hypertensive disease. Main logical issue(s): None; the stem provides sufficient clinical context, the options are mutually exclusive, and only B aligns with the described pathophysiology. Main medical accuracy issue(s): None; the explanation accurately reflects current ASE/EACVI consensus and published data.
