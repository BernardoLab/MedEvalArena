The stem presents a classic MELAS phenotype (stroke-like episodes, mitochondrial myopathy, lactic acidosis) and a muscle biopsy heteroplasmy level of 38%. The key discriminating finding is the heteroplasmy level in the context of a compatible clinical picture. The keyed answer (C) correctly states this level is above the threshold for clinical expression and supports the diagnosis, aligning with current criteria where levels as low as 30% in muscle can be diagnostic with a typical phenotype. The alternatives are incorrect: (A) cites an incorrect, overly high threshold; (B) incorrectly dismisses clinical correlation; (D) incorrectly prioritizes blood testing; (E) suggests unnecessary repeat biopsy. The item is logically valid, medically accurate, and has a single defensible best answer. Minimal fix: None required; the item is sound as written.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"T\",\n    \"logical_validity\": true,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n

Key stem clues: asymptomatic athlete, QTc 315 ms (short QT), pathogenic KCNH2 mutation, family history of sudden cardiac death. The 2022 ESC guidelines for short QT syndrome (SQTS) recommend an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for primary prevention in asymptomatic patients with a pathogenic mutation and a family history of sudden cardiac death. Quinidine is suggested as an alternative or adjunct, but ICD is the primary recommendation. The keyed answer (C, quinidine) is not the guideline-directed best answer, making the item miskeyed. The main logical issue is miskeying (K). The medical accuracy is sound regarding guideline content. Minimal fix: Change the correct answer key to B (ICD) or, if intending to test quinidine, significantly alter the vignette to describe a patient refusing an ICD or having a contraindication.\",\n  \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n  \"logical_validity\": false,\n  \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n  \"4\"\n}",

The stem describes thyroid storm with cardiogenic shock and severe systolic dysfunction (LVEF 15%, CI 1.8 L/min/m²). The keyed answer (C, Milrinone) is a phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor providing inotropy and vasodilation. However, in cardiogenic shock with hypotension, a pure vasodilator/inodilator like milrinone is typically contraindicated as first-line due to risk of worsening hypotension. The most appropriate initial vasoactive agent in this context, per guidelines, is an inotrope like dobutamine (B) to support cardiac output, often with careful vasopressor addition if needed for perfusion pressure. The item's logic incorrectly prioritizes afterload reduction over inotropic support in shock.

The stem clearly describes deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2 (DADA2) with recurrent strokes and vasculitis. The keyed answer (C, etanercept) is a recognized, guideline-supported first-line therapy for preventing strokes in DADA2. However, option D (anakinra, an IL-1 inhibitor) is also a valid and increasingly used first-line biologic therapy per current literature and expert consensus, creating a scenario where two options are defensible as 'first-line.' This makes the item logically invalid due to multiple defensible answers (M). The primary failure is miskeying (K) because the provided key selects one of two defensible options, but the underlying issue is the presence of two correct therapies.

The question asks for the pathophysiologic mechanism linking fetal hydrops/mirror syndrome to maternal preeclampsia-like features. The key stem clue is the association of mirror syndrome (maternal edema mirroring fetal hydrops) with a preeclampsia phenotype. The keyed answer (B) is consistent with the accepted pathophysiology: placental edema in mirror syndrome leads to release of anti-angiogenic factors like sFlt-1, mimicking preeclampsia. Alternatives are incorrect: A (fetomaternal hemorrhage) is a cause of hydrops, not the maternal syndrome; C (Rh antibodies) is the cause of the hydrops, not the maternal preeclampsia features; D (amniotic fluid embolism) is acute and not linked to hydrops; E denies the diagnosis stated in the stem. No logical contradictions or missing details are present. Medical accuracy is sound. A minimal fix is not required, but specifying 'placental edema in the setting of fetal hydrops' could slightly enhance clarity.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"T\",\n    \"logical_validity\":

The stem provides a specific imaging pattern (subendocardial LGE with epicardial sparing) in a patient with EGPA. This pattern is a recognized discriminator in cardiac MRI, where subendocardial enhancement is associated with chronic fibrosis, while epicardial/mid-wall enhancement correlates with active inflammation. The keyed answer (C) correctly identifies the prognostic implication of fibrosis and poor response to immunosuppression. The alternatives are less defensible: A is incorrect as the pattern suggests fibrosis, not active inflammation; B is not directly indicated by the pattern; D is incorrect as the pattern has clear prognostic significance; E is an invasive step not mandated by the imaging finding alone. The item is logically valid, medically accurate, and supports a single best answer. Minimal fix: None required; the item is sound as written.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"T\",\n    \"logical_validity\": true,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n

The stem provides a specific molecular subtype (TYR-methylation class) of atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (ATRT) and asks for the most critical prognostic factor. The key stem clues are the histopathologic diagnosis (ATRT) and the specified methylation class, which in current neuro-oncology risk stratification is the dominant prognostic determinant. The keyed answer (D) correctly identifies DNA methylation subclassification as the most critical factor, aligning with modern literature where methylation class (TYR, SHH, MYC) supersedes age, SMARCB1 status (which is universal), and extent of resection in prognostic importance. Each alternative is less correct: A (SMARCB1 deletion) is a diagnostic feature, not prognostic; B (age) is secondary; C (MYC amplification) is not the primary classifier; E (surgical resection) is a treatment factor.

The question asks which speckle-tracking finding best distinguishes ATTRwt amyloidosis from hypertensive heart disease. The key stem clue is the diagnosis of ATTRwt amyloidosis with reduced LVEF. The keyed answer (B, relative apical sparing ratio >1.5) is the established echocardiographic hallmark for cardiac amyloidosis, characterized by preserved apical strain relative to severely reduced basal strain. This pattern is not typical of hypertensive heart disease, which usually shows more homogeneous or basal-predominant strain reduction. Alternatives are incorrect: global longitudinal strain -8% (A) is non-specifically reduced; basal sparing (C) is the opposite of the amyloid pattern; circumferential strain >-15% (D) is not a primary discriminator; longitudinal strain <10% with basal predominance (E) describes hypertensive pattern, not amyloid.

Key stem clues: The question asks for the target glucose range during high-dose insulin euglycemia therapy (HIET) for verapamil overdose. The standard, widely accepted target for HIET in calcium channel blocker overdose is euglycemia, typically defined as 100-200 mg/dL, with a common practice of 150-250 mg/dL to proactively prevent hypoglycemia from high insulin doses. Main logical issue: A unique best answer exists, but the provided key (B: 110-180 mg/dL) is not it. The most evidence-based and guideline-supported target is a range like 150-250 mg/dL, which is not listed. Option C (180-250 mg/dL) is closer to the standard but still not ideal. Main medical accuracy issue: The keyed answer reflects an inappropriate conflation of HIET targets with general ICU glycemic control. Minimal fix: Change the key to C and update the rationale to cite specific toxicology guidelines (e.g., ACMT) supporting a permissive range of 150-250 mg/dL to prevent hypoglycemia while ensuring insulin efficacy.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n    \"logical_validity\": false,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \"2\"\n}",
