Ambulatory monitoring shows bidirectional ventricular tachycardia at 180 bpm during exercise. Baseline QTc is 410 ms. Which long-term pharmacologic strategy is most likely to prevent arrhythmic recurrence?", "options": ["Nadolol 1 mg/kg/day with exercise restriction", "Flecainide 100 mg twice daily as monotherapy", "Nadolol 1 mg/kg/day plus flecainide 100 mg twice daily", "Verapamil 240 mg daily with ICD backup", "ICD implantation with sotalol 120 mg twice daily"], "answer": "C", "answer_index": 2, "explanation": "Specific RYR2 mutations in the channel core (exon 3) demonstrate poor response to beta-blockade alone; combination therapy with flecainide provides synergistic RyR2 stabilization by reducing calcium leak.
