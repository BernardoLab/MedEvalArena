While theoretical risks of hemorrhage exist due to vessel pathology, case series suggest safety, and withholding tPA is not the standard of care. Option E (Mechanical thrombectomy) is typically not *indicated* for pure small vessel disease (lacunar infarcts) due to lack of a target large vessel occlusion, but it is not strictly 'contraindicated' by pathophysiology if an LVO were present.
