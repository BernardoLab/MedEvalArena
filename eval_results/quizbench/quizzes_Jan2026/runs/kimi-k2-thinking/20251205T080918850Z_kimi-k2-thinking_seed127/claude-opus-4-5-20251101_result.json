Often more aggressive behavior with higher malignancy risk\n\nThe catecholamine synthesis in SDH tumors is characterized by:\n- Impaired conversion of norepinephrine to epinephrine\n- High norepinephrine production\n- These tumors may have particularly high catecholamine synthesis rates\n\nPreoperative preparation options:\n- Phenoxybenzamine: Alpha-blocker that blocks catecholamine effects at receptors\n- Metyrosine (alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine): Inhibits tyrosine hydroxylase, reducing catecholamine SYNTHESIS\n\nFor SDH-related tumors with their high norepinephrine synthesis profile, the combination of:\n1. Alpha-blockade (phenoxybenzamine) to block receptor effects\n2. Metyrosine to reduce catecholamine synthesis at the source\n\nThis combination approach is particularly valuable in tumors with high catecholamine production, as it addresses both the synthesis and the receptor-level effects. SDH-related tumors often have robust catecholamine synthesis, making metyrosine addition beneficial.\n\nOption C (Phenoxybenzamine plus metyrosine for 10-14 days) addresses both the receptor blockade and the unique high-synthesis profile of SDH-related tumors.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}]
