Key stem clues: genotype-positive, phenotype-negative CPVT with exon 3 RYR2 mutation; syncope with bidirectional VT on exercise; baseline QTc normal. The item correctly identifies a specific high-risk mutation (exon 3, channel core) known in guidelines to have suboptimal response to beta-blocker monotherapy, making combination therapy (nadolol + flecainide) the most likely effective pharmacologic strategy. No logical contradictions exist. Medical accuracy is high, aligning with recent consensus on genotype-directed therapy. The only minor nuance is that 'phenotype-negative' is slightly atypical phrasing post-syncope with documented VT, but it likely indicates no baseline ECG signs. Minimal fix: Clarify 'phenotype-negative' as 'asymptomatic at rest with normal baseline ECG' to avoid ambiguity.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"T\",\n    \"logical_validity\": true,\n

Key stem clues: hyperammonemia, low citrulline/arginine, undetectable urine orotic acid, and elevated glutamine point to a proximal urea cycle defect (CPS1 or NAGS deficiency). The keyed answer (B, carglumic acid) is the definitive treatment for N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) deficiency, not CPS1 deficiency. The rationale incorrectly states carglumic acid activates CPS1; it replaces the missing N-acetylglutamate in NAGS deficiency. For CPS1 deficiency, the primary defect is not addressed by any listed drug; arginine (D) is a standard supportive therapy to drive the downstream urea cycle, making it a more logical 'best' answer given the options, though not a direct enzyme replacement. Main logical issue: The key does not match the most defensible answer based on the pathophysiology presented. Main medical issue: The rationale contains a pathophysiological inaccuracy regarding carglumic acid's mechanism. Minimal fix: Change the rationale to correctly state carglumic acid is for NAGS deficiency, or change the vignette findings (e.g., mention NAGS deficiency) to match the key.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n    \"logical_validity\": false,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \"2\"\n}",

Key stem clues: jellyfish sting off Great Barrier Reef, initial pain resolves, delayed (45 min) severe back pain, dyspnea, pulmonary edema, and severe hypertension. This classic presentation is Irukandji syndrome. The pathophysiologic cascade involves catecholamine storm. The therapy that specifically antagonizes this cascade is verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, which is a well-documented, specific treatment for Irukandji-induced hypertension and myocardial dysfunction. Magnesium sulfate, while used for some envenomations, is not the specific, first-line antagonist for Irukandji catecholamine effects in this acute, severe hypertensive setting. Main logical issue: A unique best answer (E) exists, but the provided key (B) is incorrect. Main medical accuracy issue: Magnesium is not the standard specific antagonist for this syndrome's hypertensive crisis. Minimal fix: Change the correct answer key from B to E.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n    \"logical_validity\": false,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n

The stem clearly describes deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2 (DADA2), a monogenic autoinflammatory disease. The keyed answer is adalimumab, a TNF-α inhibitor. However, the rationale provided states that etanercept can paradoxically worsen inflammation, implying it is inferior. This creates a direct contradiction: if etanercept is contraindicated, then adalimumab is the correct therapeutic choice. The item is therefore miskeyed because the correct answer (D) is not the one indicated as correct in the provided 'Correct answer key' field, which is also 'D'. The logical failure is that the key and the explanation are inconsistent. The medical content is accurate regarding DADA2 pathophysiology and the superiority of monoclonal anti-TNF over etanercept. Minimal fix: Correct the key to match the intended correct answer, which is D (Adalimumab), and ensure the 'Correct answer key' field reflects this.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n

Key stem clues: young adult, mild persistent fasting hyperglycemia (108-115 mg/dL), mildly elevated HbA1c (6.1-6.3%), normal BMI, negative autoantibodies, family history of mild hyperglycemia, and identification of a heterozygous GCK (glucokinase) pathogenic variant. This profile is classic for GCK-MODY (MODY 2). The logical flow is sound; the question asks for the management strategy supported by longitudinal natural history data. The keyed answer (D, no pharmacologic therapy) is strongly supported by the established natural history of GCK-MODY, which demonstrates a stable, mild hyperglycemia without increased risk of diabetic complications, making pharmacologic treatment unnecessary and ineffective. The alternatives are all pharmacologic interventions, which are not indicated. No contradictions or underspecification exist. The medical content is accurate.

The keyed answer (C, carbamazepine) is not the best-supported choice. For KCNQ2-related disorders, gain-of-function mutations cause a distinct, self-limited neonatal epilepsy that is typically exquisitely responsive to sodium channel blockers, but carbamazepine and phenytoin (B, C) are both sodium channel blockers. The vignette provides no detail to discriminate between these two options, making them equally plausible and creating a 'multiple defensible' (M) scenario. The medical accuracy is sound regarding the general drug class, but the item is logically flawed due to the indistinguishable options. Minimal fix: Remove one of the redundant sodium channel blockers (e.g., change option B or C to a mechanistically distinct, incorrect choice) to force a unique best answer.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"M\",\n    \"logical_validity\": false,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \"4\"\n}",

Key stem clues: acute hemiparesis, NIHSS 8, presentation <90 minutes, MRI findings of anterior temporal lobe and external capsule T2 hyperintensities are classic for CADASIL. The question asks for an intervention contraindicated due to disease-specific pathophysiology. The keyed answer (A, IV tPA) is not definitively contraindicated in CADASIL; major guidelines do not list it as an absolute contraindication, and the risk-benefit in an acute disabling stroke within the window favors tPA. The rationale incorrectly states thrombolysis carries 'excessive hemorrhagic risk,' which is not a consensus contraindication. Option E (Mechanical thrombectomy) is a more defensible 'contraindicated' answer for this clinical picture, as the MRI pattern suggests small vessel (lacunar) disease, not a large vessel occlusion amenable to thrombectomy. Main logical issue: The key does not match the most defensible best answer. Main medical accuracy issue: Overstates the contraindication to tPA in CADASIL. Minimal fix: Change the key to E and adjust the rationale to focus on the inappropriateness of thrombectomy for lacunar strokes.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n    \"logical_validity\":

Key stem clues: lifelong recurrent fevers, abdominal pain, myalgia, periorbital edema, and a confirmed TNFRSF1A cysteine mutation establish the diagnosis of TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS). The question explicitly asks for a biologic therapy preferred over etanercept due to mechanistic considerations. The provided rationale correctly states that etanercept can bind the mutant receptor and potentially prolong inflammation, making IL-1 inhibition (anakinra) the preferred biologic. The other options are incorrect: colchicine is not a biologic and is ineffective; etanercept is the agent to be avoided; canakinumab and tocilizumab are biologics but target IL-1β and IL-6, respectively, and are not first-line for TRAPS. The item is logically valid and medically accurate.

The question asks for the preoperative strategy for an SDHB-related pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (PCC/PGL) given high normetanephrine. Key stem clues are the confirmed SDHB mutation and the biochemical evidence of catecholamine excess, which in SDHx tumors is associated with high synthesis rates. The provided rationale correctly states that combined alpha-blockade and catecholamine synthesis inhibition is the recommended approach for these high-risk tumors, making option C the single best answer. The item is medically accurate and logically valid. Alternatives are inferior: A (alpha-blockade alone) may be insufficient; B (metyrosine alone) lacks alpha-blockade; D (immediate surgery) is dangerous without preparation; E (amlodipine) is inadequate. No missing details or contradictions. A minimal fix is not needed, but the stem could explicitly state 'pheochromocytoma' for absolute clarity, though it is strongly implied.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"T\",\n
