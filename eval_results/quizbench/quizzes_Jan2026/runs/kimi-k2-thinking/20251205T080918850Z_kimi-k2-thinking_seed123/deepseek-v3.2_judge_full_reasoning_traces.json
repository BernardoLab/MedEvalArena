Key stem clues: DDDR pacemaker, symptomatic despite PMT termination, telemetry shows intermittent 2:1 AV block due to P waves falling in PVARP. The core problem is preventing PMT initiation while preserving AV synchrony, not just terminating it. The dynamic PVARP extension after PVCs (B) specifically addresses the described mechanism of PMT initiation from retrograde conduction after a PVC, which is a classic trigger, without worsening the 2:1 block during sinus tracking. Other options are inferior: static PVARP extension (A) worsens the block; reducing upper rate (C) doesn't prevent initiation; DDI (D) loses tracking; atrial preference pacing (E) is for sinus node dysfunction, not PMT. The item is logically valid and medically accurate. Minimal fix: None required; the item is sound.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"T\",\n    \"logical_validity\": true,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n

The stem clearly identifies a patient with early-stage ALSP (CSF1R mutation) and a family history of rapid progression, asking for the intervention with highest disease-modifying efficacy before severe motor disability. The key discriminating finding is the early stage before severe motor disability, which is the critical window for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in this condition. Keyed answer C (Allogeneic HSCT) is supported by current literature indicating it can halt progression by replacing dysfunctional microglia when performed early. Alternatives are correctly inferior: IVIG (A) and cyclophosphamide (B) lack efficacy, ruxolitinib (D) has no data, and supportive care (E) is not disease-modifying. The item is logically valid and medically accurate, aligning with consensus that early HSCT is the only potentially curative intervention. No fix needed.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"T\",\n    \"logical_validity\": true,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n

Key stem clues: metastatic hemangiopericytoma, refractory hypoglycemia, low insulin/C-peptide, high IGF-2 and IGF-2:IGF-1 ratio, establishing non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia (NICTH). Main logical issue: A unique best answer exists, but the provided key (A) is not it. Glucocorticoids (A) are a documented treatment for NICTH but are not the most rapid pharmacologic intervention for immediate euglycemia; they often take days. Recombinant IGF-1 (B) is a targeted therapy but is not standard immediate care. Diazoxide (C) and octreotide (D) are ineffective in this insulin-independent hypoglycemia. Glucagon (E) provides transient glucose elevation but cannot sustain euglycemia for 24 hours, making it a poor 'most likely' choice. The most accurate immediate pharmacologic intervention for refractory NICTH, per standard guidelines, is high-dose recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH), which is not an option. Medical accuracy issue: The keyed answer (glucocorticoids) is not the fastest-acting agent, and the most effective standard drug is omitted. Minimal fix: Replace option A with 'Recombinant human growth hormone 1 mg subcutaneously daily' and key it as correct.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n    \"logical_validity\": false,\n

The stem provides classic clinical and imaging features of pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis (PPFE): upper lobe predominance, pleural thickening, traction bronchiectasis, and volume loss on HRCT, plus biopsy showing dense subpleural fibrosis with prominent elastic fiber deposition. The key discriminating histopathologic feature differentiating PPFE from usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) is elastosis involving the visceral pleura and subpleural parenchyma (D). The other options are correctly identified as features of UIP (A, B, E) or organizing pneumonia (C). The item is logically valid, medically accurate, and the key is correct.

The question asks for the parameter that best predicts durable repair and successful leafaptation after annuloplasty in Barlow's disease. The keyed answer (C, Annular height to commissural width ratio >0.3) is a recognized metric for assessing annular non-planarity and is associated with repair complexity, but it is not the strongest predictor of post-repair coaptation. The most widely accepted and strongest predictor from the given options is flail gap distance <10 mm (D), as a smaller gap is directly associated with successful leaflet approximation and is a standard intraoperative target. The stem lacks a critical detail specifying the timing (e.g., pre-repair vs. post-repair target) or the primary surgical goal, making the key choice ambiguous. Main medical issue: The rationale overstates the primacy of annular geometry over direct leaflet pathology metrics for coaptation prediction. Minimal fix: Change the key to D and adjust the rationale to state that a small flail gap is the strongest pre-repair predictor of achieving coaptation.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n

Key stem clues: CAIS (46,XY, null AR mutation) with hypertension, hypokalemia, suppressed renin, elevated aldosterone. This defines apparent mineralocorticoid excess (AME). The explanation incorrectly posits a unique, direct androgen-mediated mineralocorticoid effect in CAIS. In standard pathophysiology, the mineralocorticoid excess in CAIS is due to non-ACTH-dependent adrenal androgen overproduction, which can be converted to potent mineralocorticoids (e.g., via 11β-HSD2 inhibition by androgens) or act as weak mineralocorticoid receptor agonists. The most specific pharmacologic target for AME from adrenal androgens is a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. Both spironolactone (B) and eplerenone (A) are valid MRAs. Spironolactone has additional anti-androgen effects, but the question asks for an agent targeting 'mineralocorticoid excess,' not residual androgen activity. This makes A and B equally defensible, leading to M (Multiple defensible). The provided key (B) is not uniquely best. Main medical issue: Oversimplified/unproven mechanism for androgen action in CAIS-induced AME. Minimal fix: Revise stem to specify 'preferred agent to also treat associated hirsutism' to uniquely justify spironolactone, or change key to A if targeting pure mineralocorticoid excess with fewer side effects is the teaching goal.\",\n  \"logical_false_reason\": \"M\",\n  \"logical_validity\": false,\n  \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \"3\"\n}",

Key stem clues: aortobronchial fistula with active bleeding and hypotension demands immediate definitive hemorrhage control. TEVAR is the standard of care. The item hinges on the adjunct of subclavian revascularization, but the stem lacks critical details (e.g., left vertebral artery dominance, prior CABG using LIMA) to make C uniquely 'lowest mortality' over B. Without these, B and C are both defensible, making the key arbitrary. Medical accuracy is sound (TEVAR over open repair). Minimal fix: Specify in the stem a relevant anatomical or surgical history (e.g., 'a patent left vertebral artery is the dominant posterior circulation supply') to justify revascularization as the immediate, lowest-mortality choice.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n    \"logical_validity\": false,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n
