Verdict: Miskeyed. Key stem clues: aortobronchial fistula with active bleeding and hypotension demands immediate definitive hemorrhage control. TEVAR is the standard of care. The item hinges on the adjunct of subclavian revascularization, but the stem lacks critical details (e.g., left vertebral artery dominance, prior CABG using LIMA) to make C uniquely 'lowest mortality' over B. Without these, B and C are both defensible, making the key arbitrary. Medical accuracy is sound (TEVAR over open repair). Minimal fix: Specify in the stem a relevant anatomical or surgical history (e.g., 'a patent left vertebral artery is the dominant posterior circulation supply') to justify revascularization as the immediate, lowest-mortality choice.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n    \"logical_validity\": false,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":", "judge_output_valid": false, "judge_parse_error": "json decode error: Expecting value: line 5 column 30 (char 883)"}]
