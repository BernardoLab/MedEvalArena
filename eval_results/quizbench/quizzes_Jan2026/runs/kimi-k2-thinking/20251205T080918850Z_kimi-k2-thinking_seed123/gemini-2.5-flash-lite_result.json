The device interrogation reveals normal leads but ongoing PMT episodes, which the device algorithm attempts to terminate. Telemetry shows intermittent 2:1 AV block with P waves falling within the post-ventricular atrial refractory period (PVARP). This means that native atrial impulses occurring after a ventricular event are being blocked because they fall within the PVARP, leading to a 2:1 AV block pattern and potentially contributing to the difficulty in maintaining AV synchrony. Meanwhile, PMT occurs when an atrial event (often retrograde conduction from the ventricle) is sensed after the PVARP, triggering a ventricular pace that re-establishes the cycle.\n\nThe goal is to eliminate symptoms (from PMT) while preserving maximal atrioventricular (AV) synchrony.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\nA.  Extend PVARP by 50 ms: Extending the PVARP will make it more difficult for retrograde atrial signals to be sensed, thus helping to prevent PMT. However, the observation that \"every second P wave falling within PVARP\" already indicates significant interference with AV conduction, leading to intermittent 2:1 AV block. A fixed extension of PVARP would likely worsen this AV block and compromise AV synchrony, contradicting the goal of preserving maximal synchrony.\n\nB.  Enable dynamic PVARP extension after premature ventricular contractions: Dynamic PVARP extension is a feature designed to prevent PMT. It automatically prolongs the PVARP only when a potential VA conduction loop is detected (e.g., sensing a ventricular event followed by a risk of sensing a retrograde atrial signal). This targeted approach prevents PMT episodes by blocking retrograde conduction without causing persistent AV block or reducing AV synchrony when PMT is not being initiated. This option directly addresses PMT while attempting to minimize its impact on normal AV conduction.\n\nC.  Reduce upper tracking limit to 120 bpm: Reducing the upper tracking limit (UTL) is primarily a rate control strategy. If the patient's symptoms were due to tracking rates above 120 bpm due to atrial arrhythmias, this might be considered. However, the primary identified issue is PMT, and reducing the UTL would likely enforce more AV block (e.g., switch to 2:1 block) when the intrinsic atrial rate is between the current UTL and 120 bpm, potentially reducing AV synchrony without directly resolving the PMT mechanism itself.\n\nD.  Switch to DDI mode at rest: DDI mode prevents PMT by not tracking the atrium with the ventricular pacemaker. However, it sacrifices AV synchrony by disabling the AV synchrony function, which is crucial for patients with sick sinus syndrome. This is not compatible with preserving maximal AV synchrony.\n\nE.  Enable atrial preference pacing: Atrial preference pacing prioritizes atrial pacing, which can be beneficial for maintaining atrial base rate in SSS. However, it can potentially increase the incidence of PMT by ensuring more frequent atrial pacing events that can then lead to ventricular pacing and retrograde conduction.\n\nConsidering the goal of eliminating PMT while preserving maximal AV synchrony, option B is the most appropriate. Dynamic PVARP extension is specifically designed to tackle PMT by intelligently adjusting the PVARP only when necessary, thereby minimizing the negative impact on AV synchrony. The existing 2:1 block due to P waves falling within PVARP suggests that fixed extension (A) would be detrimental to AV synchrony.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."}, {"quiz_id": "20251205T080918850Z_kimi-k2-thinking_seed123", "question_id": "20251205T080918850Z_kimi-k2-thinking_seed123-002", "question": "A 42-year-old man with a heterozygous CSF1R p.Arg782His mutation and early-stage adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids (ALSP) has mild cognitive impairment and gait instability.

ALSP associated with CSF1R mutations is a monogenic disorder affecting microglia, which are derived from hematopoietic stem cells. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) aims to replace the patient's dysregulated myeloid progenitor cells, including microglia, with those from a healthy donor. This can potentially halt or significantly slow disease progression by restoring functional microglia. Studies and case reports have shown that HSCT can be highly effective in treating certain hereditary leukoencephalopathies, including those caused by CSF1R mutations, particularly when administered early, before severe neurological disability has developed.\n\nLet's evaluate the other options:\nA. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is typically used for immune-mediated neurological disorders, and there is no established evidence of its efficacy in ALSP caused by CSF1R mutations.\nB. Oral cyclophosphamide is a potent immunosuppressant.

Let's analyze the options:\n\nA. Continuous hydrocortisone infusion 10 mg/hour: Glucocorticoids like hydrocortisone are gluconeogenic agents. They increase hepatic glucose production and decrease peripheral glucose utilization, thereby raising blood glucose levels. This is a well-established and frequently effective treatment for severe, refractory hypoglycemia, especially that caused by paraneoplastic syndromes like NICTH. A continuous infusion provides a sustained effect.\n\nB. Recombinant IGF-1 40 mg subcutaneously twice daily: This would worsen the hypoglycemia, as the patient already has excessively high IGF-2 levels with an insulin-like effect.\n\nC. Diazoxide 300 mg orally three times daily: Diazoxide is a potassium channel opener that inhibits insulin secretion. It is effective for hypoglycemia due to endogenous hyperinsulinism (e.g., insulinoma) but does not address hypoglycemia caused by IGF-2.\n\nD. Octreotide 200 μg subcutaneously three times daily: Octreotide, a somatostatin analog, can inhibit the secretion of various hormones. While it may reduce IGF-2 production from certain tumors, its efficacy in NICTH is variable and it's generally not the first-line treatment for acute, severe hypoglycemia.\n\nE. Glucagon 2 mg intramuscularly every 4 hours: Glucagon stimulates glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, thus raising blood glucose. However, for severe and refractory hypoglycemia, particularly when associated with tumor production of IGF-2 that continuously lowers glucose, intermittent glucagon injections every 4 hours might not achieve sustained euglycemia. A continuous glucagon infusion is sometimes used, but the proposed regimen may not be aggressive enough.\n\nConsidering the severity, refractoriness, and specific etiology (NICTH due to IGF-2), continuous hydrocortisone infusion is the most likely intervention to achieve euglycemia within 24 hours due to its direct and sustained impact on glucose homeostasis.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$."}, {"quiz_id": "20251205T080918850Z_kimi-k2-thinking_seed123", "question_id": "20251205T080918850Z_kimi-k2-thinking_seed123-004", "question": "A 59-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate develops progressive dyspnea and weight loss.

Fibroblast foci within alveolar walls: Fibroblast foci are characteristic features of UIP, representing active fibrotic areas. Their presence would support a UIP diagnosis, not differentiate from it.\n\nB. Honeycomb change with mucin-filled cysts: Honeycomb change is a key feature of advanced UIP, reflecting cystic airspaces. Mucin-filled cysts might be seen in some drug-induced lung diseases or other conditions but are not the *most* differentiating feature from UIP itself, especially when compared to more specific findings.\n\nC. Presence of intra-alveolar fibroblastic plugs: These are commonly seen in organizing pneumonia patterns (like COP/BOOP) or acute lung injury, but can also be present in other interstitial lung diseases, including to some extent in UIP or drug reactions. They are not as specific for differentiation as other findings.\n\nD. Elastosis involving visceral pleura and subpleural parenchyma: The biopsy description explicitly mentions \"prominent elastic fiber deposition\" and the involvement of the \"pleura and subpleural parenchyma.\" Elastosis, or excessive deposition of elastic fibers, is not a typical or defining feature of UIP. UIP is characterized by collagenous fibrosis, honeycombing, and architectural distortion. The prominent deposition of elastic fibers, especially in the subpleural region and pleura, is a notable deviation from the UIP pattern and can be seen in reactive fibrotic processes, including those associated with connective tissue diseases or certain drug toxicities (like methotrexate). This finding directly contrasts with the typical histology of UIP.\n\nE. Patchy temporally heterogeneous fibrosis: Temporal heterogeneity, meaning the simultaneous presence of both active (fibroblastic foci) and chronic (fibrosis, honeycombing) lesions at different stages of development, is a cardinal diagnostic criterion for usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). Its presence would strongly suggest UIP.\n\nGiven the biopsy findings of \"prominent elastic fiber deposition\" and the question asking for differentiation from UIP, elastosis (option D) is the finding that is least characteristic of UIP and therefore most strongly differentiates the described condition from UIP. The HRCT findings of upper lobe predominance and pleural thickening, combined with the biopsy finding of prominent elastosis, suggest a process other than typical UIP, potentially a drug-induced or autoimmune-related fibrotic interstitial pneumonia with an unusual matrix deposition pattern.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$."}, {"quiz_id": "20251205T080918850Z_kimi-k2-thinking_seed123", "question_id": "20251205T080918850Z_kimi-k2-thinking_seed123-005", "question": "A 26-year-old woman ingests 60 mg of colchicine in a suicide attempt, presenting 8 hours later with profuse vomiting and diarrhea.

Let's analyze the options:\n\nA. Colchicine-specific Fab fragments: There are no specific antibody fragments (Fab) available for colchicine. Colchicine is a small molecule and not suitable for this type of antibody-based antidote.\n\nB. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF): G-CSF stimulates white blood cell production and is used in conditions like neutropenia. It is not indicated for colchicine poisoning, which can cause leukocytosis initially. There is no evidence that G-CSF reduces mortality in colchicine poisoning.\n\nC. Continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH): While hemofiltration can remove some toxins, colchicine has high protein binding and cellular uptake, making its removal by hemodialysis or hemofiltration inefficient. Evidence for significant mortality reduction using CVVH in colchicine poisoning is limited.\n\nD. N-acetylcysteine (NAC): NAC is the antidote for acetaminophen overdose. It has no role in the management of colchicine poisoning and has not demonstrated any mortality reduction for this condition.\n\nE. Plasma exchange: Plasma exchange (plasmapheresis) is a procedure that removes plasma from the body and is sometimes used in poisonings to remove toxins.

Let's analyze the options:\n\nA. Anterior leaflet length >35 mm: While leaflet length is important, excessive length in Barlow's disease can sometimes indicate redundancy that might be difficult to manage for a durable repair. This specific threshold is not as universally cited as other predictors.\n\nB. Posterior leaflet thickness >5 mm: Thickening of leaflets is characteristic of Barlow's disease but does not directly predict the success of coaptation or durability as strongly as parameters related to leaflet displacement or overlap dynamics.\n\nC. Annular height to commissural width ratio >0.3: This ratio relates to the shape of the mitral annulus. A low ratio indicates a more flattened annulus, which can be associated with mitral regurgitation. A ratio >0.3 suggests a more normal or rounded annulus, which might be favorable, but it's less directly predictive of leaflet coaptation mechanics compared to leaflet-specific parameters.\n\nD. Flail gap distance <10 mm: The flail gap is the distance between the free edges of the prolapsed leaflet segments when the valve is closed. A smaller flail gap (<10 mm) indicates less severe prolapse of these segments, making it easier to achieve good leaflet coaptation after resection or plication of the prolapsed tissue and subsequent annuloplasty. This is a well-established predictor of successful mitral valve repair.\n\nE. Coaptation depth >15 mm: The term \"coaptation depth\" can be interpreted in several ways, leading to ambiguity. If it refers to the coaptation *length* (i.e., the extent of leaflet overlap when the valve is closed), a very long overlap (>15 mm) might be considered favorable, provided the tissue is manageable. However, in Barlow's disease, leaflets can be extensively redundant, and very long leaflets might pose repair challenges. If \"coaptation depth\" refers to the coaptation *gap* (the distance between leaflets that fail to coapt), then a gap >15 mm would be a strong predictor of repair failure. Given the context of predicting *successful* repair, a large gap would be unfavorable. Thus, the latter interpretation would make option E a predictor of failure.\n\nComparing options D and E, the flail gap distance (D) provides a direct and unambiguous measure of the extent to which prolapsed leaflets are separated.

Pharmacological agents that target mineralocorticoid excess can do so by either reducing the production of aldosterone or by blocking its action at the mineralocorticoid receptor.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\nA. Eplerenone: This is a selective aldosterone receptor antagonist. It specifically blocks the binding of aldosterone to the mineralocorticoid receptor, thereby reducing sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion in the kidneys. This directly targets the effects of excessive aldosterone.\nB. Spironolactone: This is a non-selective aldosterone receptor antagonist. It also blocks the mineralocorticoid receptor but has additional anti-androgenic and progestogenic effects due to its action on androgen and progesterone receptors. While it effectively treats mineralocorticoid excess, its non-selectivity is a consideration. In this patient with CAIS due to a null AR mutation, she is completely insensitive to androgens, so the anti-androgenic effect might be less clinically significant than it would be in other patients, but eplerenone's greater selectivity for the mineralocorticoid receptor makes it a purer agent for targeting aldosterone action.\nC.

It works downstream.\nD. Dexamethasone: This is a potent glucocorticoid.

However, it is not the primary treatment for most forms of primary aldosteronism, especially those due to adenomas or bilateral hyperplasia where aldosterone production is independent of ACTH.\nE.

The lung biopsy finding of \"diffuse capillary proliferation within alveolar septa without cellular atypia\" is suggestive of pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH) or a related microvascular disorder, which is a rare subset within WHO Group 1 PAH. The patient has failed aggressive medical therapy, including epoprostenol (a potent intravenous prostacyclin analog) and macitentan (an endothelin receptor antagonist).\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. Switching to inhaled treprostinil, while a prostacyclin, is generally considered less potent than IV epoprostenol. For a patient with NYHA class IV disease refractory to IV prostacyclin, this is unlikely to provide the greatest 5-year survival.\nB. Adding selexipag, a prostacyclin receptor agonist, is a reasonable step in medical therapy for PAH, often used as an add-on to dual therapy. However, given the patient's severe symptoms (NYHA IV) and failure of maximal medical therapy including IV prostacyclin and ERA, it is unlikely to offer the *greatest* 5-year survival compared to definitive treatment for end-stage disease.\nC. Combination immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide is not a standard treatment for PAH itself, even in the context of systemic sclerosis. While SSc is an autoimmune disease, therapy is directed at managing SSc activity and its direct complications like PAH. Immunosuppression is typically reserved for active, severe organ involvement beyond PAH itself.\nD. Bilateral lung transplantation is the definitive treatment for end-stage, severe, and refractory PAH when medical therapies have failed. For patients with NYHA class IV symptoms who do not respond to maximal medical therapy, transplantation offers the only chance for significant long-term survival. Given the severity and refractory nature of the disease, this intervention is associated with the greatest potential for 5-year survival.\nE. Balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) is a treatment for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), classified under WHO Group 4 PH. It is not indicated for WHO Group 1 PAH, including SSc-associated PAH or PCH.\n\nTherefore, in a patient with severe, refractory PAH and NYHA class IV symptoms, referral for lung transplantation is the intervention associated with the greatest 5-year survival.\n\nThe answer is (D)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251205T080918850Z_kimi-k2-thinking_seed123", "question_id": "20251205T080918850Z_kimi-k2-thinking_seed123-010", "question": "A 62-year-old man with chronic type B aortic dissection (diagnosed 3 years ago) presents with massive hemoptysis.

The priority is to stop the bleeding as quickly and effectively as possible with the lowest achievable mortality.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\nA. Emergent thoracotomy with open surgical repair: While open surgery can be definitive, it carries a very high mortality risk in hemodynamically unstable patients with acute aortic emergencies, especially when cardiopulmonary bypass and potential circulatory arrest are involved. This is generally reserved for patients who are not candidates for or have failed endovascular repair.\nB. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) with left subclavian coverage: TEVAR is less invasive than open surgery and is the mainstay for managing acute aortic pathology, particularly in unstable patients. If the fistula is located such that coverage of the left subclavian artery (LSA) is required for adequate proximal seal of the stent graft, this option addresses the bleeding. However, covering the LSA can lead to left arm ischemia and, more importantly, stroke if it compromises flow to the cerebral circulation.\nC. TEVAR with adjunctive left subclavian artery revascularization: This option builds upon B by performing TEVAR to seal the fistula and then addressing potential complications arising from LSA coverage by immediately revascularizing the LSA (e.g., via carotid-subclavian bypass). If the fistula's location necessitates LSA coverage for a successful repair, not revascularizing it exposes the patient to significant risks of stroke, limb ischemia, and potentially further morbidity that could increase mortality. Guidelines and literature increasingly recommend periprocedural LSA revascularization when the LSA must be covered during TEVAR to mitigate these risks, especially in critical presentations. This comprehensive approach aims to stop the bleeding and simultaneously prevent immediate life-threatening complications from the necessary arterial coverage.\nD. Balloon tamponade of the aortic true lumen: This is a temporizing measure that might reduce aortic pressure and flow, potentially slowing bleeding. However, it does not reliably seal the fistula and is unlikely to be sufficient to manage massive hemoptysis, especially for a 7 cm ulcer-like projection. It would not offer the lowest mortality compared to definitive repair.\nE. Massive transfusion protocol only: While essential for resuscitation of a hypotensive, bleeding patient, it does not address the source of the bleeding (the fistula). Without sealing the leak, continued bleeding will overwhelm any resuscitation efforts.\n\nConsidering the patient's instability and the catastrophic nature of the fistula, TEVAR is the preferred immediate strategy over open surgery. The choice between B and C depends on the necessity of LSA coverage. If LSA coverage is required for the endograft seal, current best practice suggests that adjunctive revascularization (option C) leads to better outcomes by preventing stroke and arm ischemia, thereby potentially resulting in the lowest mortality compared to simply covering the LSA. This strategy provides both immediate bleeding control and proactive mitigation of major procedural complications.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$."}]
