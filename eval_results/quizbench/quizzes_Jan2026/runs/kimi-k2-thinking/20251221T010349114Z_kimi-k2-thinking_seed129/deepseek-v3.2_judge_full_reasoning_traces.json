The stem describes a 28-year-old Ashkenazi Jewish man with progressive ataxia, dysarthria, psychosis, visual hallucinations, low hexosaminidase A activity (5% of normal), and cerebellar atrophy on MRI. This is classic for late-onset Tay-Sachs disease (LOTS). The keyed answer (B) suggests enrolling in a clinical trial of miglustat. While miglustat is a substrate reduction therapy studied in some lysosomal storage disorders (e.g., Niemann-Pick type C, Gaucher), it is not a standard or established therapy for Tay-Sachs disease (GM2 gangliosidosis). The most appropriate management, based on current standard of care and board-exam expectations, is A: Initiate antipsychotic therapy with clozapine (often preferred for treatment-resistant psychosis) and refer for genetic counseling. This addresses the most pressing symptoms and provides essential genetic counseling. Option B is not the best standard answer. Option C (intrathecal enzyme replacement) is experimental. Option D (donepezil) is not a primary therapy. Option E (palliative care only) is premature. The main logical issue is miskeying; a unique best answer (A) exists but the provided key (B) is incorrect. The main medical accuracy issue is the incorrect implication that miglustat is a standard or trial therapy for LOTS. Minimal fix: Change the key to A.\", \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\", \"logical_validity\": false, \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n \t\n \t\n \t\n \t\n \t\n \t\n \t\n \t\n \t\n \t\n \t\n \t\n \t\n
