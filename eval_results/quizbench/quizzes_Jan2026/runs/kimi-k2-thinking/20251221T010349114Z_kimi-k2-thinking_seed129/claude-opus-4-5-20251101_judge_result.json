The rationale emphasizes bromocriptine-induced vasoconstriction/hypertension risk with general anesthesia and advocates epidural for gradual titration. However, multiple issues arise: (1) The bromocriptine-general anesthesia interaction cited is not well-established in mainstream anesthesia literature; bromocriptine's primary concern is hypotension, not hypertensive crisis. (2) In severe peripartum cardiomyopathy (EF 25%), both neuraxial techniques carry significant risk: spinal causes abrupt sympathectomy/afterload reduction potentially causing cardiovascular collapse, while epidural's slower onset may be safer but still risky. (3) General anesthesia (option A: etomidate with low-dose sevoflurane) is often preferred in hemodynamically unstable patients for controlled induction and airway management, particularly in emergency settings. (4) The 'emergency' indication typically favors general anesthesia for speed. Options A and C are both defensible depending on institutional practice and urgency interpretation.
