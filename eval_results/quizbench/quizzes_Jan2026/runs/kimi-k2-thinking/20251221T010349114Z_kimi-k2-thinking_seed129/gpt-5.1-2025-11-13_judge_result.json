Options list several NSAIDs and dosing regimens; key is indomethacin.\nMain logical issues: The question assumes a specific evidence-based superiority of indomethacin for Majeed syndrome, but this is not a well-established, widely accepted standard. Management of Majeed syndrome generally centers on IL-1 blockade (e.g., anakinra, canakinumab); NSAIDs may provide symptomatic relief but one agent is not clearly superior in the literature. Thus, no option is clearly the single best evidence-based long-term treatment among NSAIDs, making the keyed answer not defensible as uniquely correct. Doses provided for several agents are within common pediatric ranges, so they cannot be excluded as clearly wrong on dosing or safety grounds (except aspirin, which is relatively contraindicated but still not addressing the core ‘most effective’ issue).\nMain medical accuracy issues: Overstates indomethacin as “NSAID of choice” and as a diagnostic test; this is not mainstream consensus.\nMinimal fix: Change stem to ask for “most appropriate biologic therapy” and offer IL‑1 inhibitor options with a clearly correct key, or provide a citation-backed, commonly taught NSAID preference if it exists.", "medical_accuracy_score": 2, "logical_validity": false, "logical_false_reason": "N", "verdict": "FAIL", "fail_reason": "N"}, "judge_verdict": "FAIL", "judge_fail_reason": "N", "judge_medical_accuracy_score": 2}, {"quiz_id": "20251221T010349114Z_kimi-k2-thinking_seed129", "question_id": "20251221T010349114Z_kimi-k2-thinking_seed129-015", "question": "A 2-year-old toddler ingests a 0.3 mg clonidine transdermal patch.
