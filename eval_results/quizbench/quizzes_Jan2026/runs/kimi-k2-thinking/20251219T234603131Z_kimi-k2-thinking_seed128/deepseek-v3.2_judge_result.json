Verdict on keyed answer: Miskeyed. Key stem clues: CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizer genotype, post-tonsillectomy, codeine administration. The question asks for the 'most critical' monitoring parameter to detect opioid toxicity. While continuous pulse oximetry (B) is a reasonable monitoring tool, the FDA's strongest recommendation for this specific high-risk scenario is to avoid codeine entirely, making the premise of monitoring for toxicity after giving a contraindicated drug problematic. The most critical action is not to administer the drug, which is not an option. Among the listed monitoring parameters, capnography (E) is the most sensitive and specific for detecting respiratory depression (the primary toxicity) and is increasingly considered standard in high-risk perioperative settings, making it a defensible best answer. This creates a miskeying issue where B is not uniquely best. Main logical issue: The keyed answer is not the single best defensible choice given the clinical context and monitoring priorities. Main medical accuracy issue: The vignette describes administering a drug that is contraindicated, which is a dangerous practice. Minimal fix: Change the stem to describe a scenario where codeine use is not absolutely contraindicated (e.g., 'is considered for pain management') or change the key to E (Capnography) and adjust the rationale.", "medical_accuracy_score": 2, "logical_validity": false, "logical_false_reason": "K", "verdict": "FAIL", "fail_reason": "K"}, "judge_verdict": "FAIL", "judge_fail_reason": "K", "judge_medical_accuracy_score": 2}, {"quiz_id": "20251219T234603131Z_kimi-k2-thinking_seed128", "question_id": "20251219T234603131Z_kimi-k2-thinking_seed128-017", "question": "A 30-year-old female with acute intermittent porphyria requires general anesthesia for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
