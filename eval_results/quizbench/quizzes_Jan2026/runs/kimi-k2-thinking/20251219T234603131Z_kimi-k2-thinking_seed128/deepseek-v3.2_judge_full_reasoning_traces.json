DOCK8 deficiency is a combined immunodeficiency with impaired T-cell, B-cell, and NK-cell function, leading to susceptibility to viral (especially herpesviruses like HSV, VZV, EBV, and HPV), bacterial (especially S. aureus and other pyogenic bacteria), and fungal infections. The stem highlights recurrent S. aureus abscesses, severe eczema, and recurrent pneumonias—all pointing to defective Th17 responses and impaired control of pyogenic bacteria and fungi. While fungal prophylaxis (C) is relevant, the predominant immunologic defect in DOCK8 deficiency is broadly impaired cellular and humoral immunity, with a particularly high risk for severe viral infections. Among the options, none perfectly 'specifically targets the predominant immunologic defect,' but the most specific prophylactic measure for DOCK8 deficiency per current guidelines (e.g., from the Immune Deficiency Foundation and clinical reviews) is antiviral prophylaxis (e.g., acyclovir for herpesviruses), which is not listed. Option E (Valganciclovir for CMV) is a specific antiviral but CMV is not the only or necessarily the most common viral threat. Given the stem's emphasis on S. aureus and eczema, antibacterial prophylaxis might be considered, but penicillin (B) does not cover S. aureus. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (A) is commonly used for Pneumocystis and also provides some antibacterial coverage, but it is not specific to the predominant defect. The item is underspecified (U) regarding what 'predominant immunologic defect' means, leading to multiple defensible answers (M) depending on interpretation. However, the primary failure is miskeying: the keyed answer is not uniquely best.

The question asks for the PFT finding most specific for phrenic nerve palsy versus other causes of dyspnea. The keyed answer (B, preserved FEV1/FVC ratio) is a hallmark of restrictive physiology, which is consistent with phrenic nerve palsy. However, the stem provides PFT data showing an FEV1/FVC of 85%, which is normal/preserved. The critical issue is that all the provided PFT values (FVC 65%, TLC 70%) are reduced, indicating a restrictive defect. Both reduced FVC (A) and reduced TLC (C) are PFT findings of restriction. Reduced TLC is the gold standard PFT criterion for diagnosing a restrictive defect, making it more specific than a preserved ratio, which can also be seen in other restrictive disorders. Therefore, option C is a more specific and defensible best answer than B, as the preserved ratio alone does not distinguish phrenic palsy from other restrictive causes, whereas a reduced TLC confirms the restrictive physiology implied by the clinical scenario. The item is internally consistent but miskeyed. Main medical accuracy issue: While the preserved ratio is characteristic of restriction, reduced TLC is the defining PFT finding for restriction and is more specific in this context.

Key stem clues: Patient has treatment-resistant schizophrenia starting clozapine; HLA-DQB1*05:02 positive (increased risk of agranulocytosis); HLA-B*38:02 negative (removes a protective allele). The question asks for the monitoring protocol 'specifically indicated based on his genetic profile.' The standard U.S. monitoring for clozapine, regardless of genotype, is weekly CBC for 6 months (26 weeks), then every 2 weeks for 6 months (to 52 weeks), then monthly thereafter (option B). This is the mandated FDA/REMS schedule.

Key stem clues: CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizer genotype, post-tonsillectomy, codeine administration. The question asks for the 'most critical' monitoring parameter to detect opioid toxicity. While continuous pulse oximetry (B) is a reasonable monitoring tool, the FDA's strongest recommendation for this specific high-risk scenario is to avoid codeine entirely, making the premise of monitoring for toxicity after giving a contraindicated drug problematic. The most critical action is not to administer the drug, which is not an option. Among the listed monitoring parameters, capnography (E) is the most sensitive and specific for detecting respiratory depression (the primary toxicity) and is increasingly considered standard in high-risk perioperative settings, making it a defensible best answer.

Key stem clues: patient in a lawsuit (suggests secondary gain), chronic pain with normal exams/imaging, inconsistent symptom presentation. The question asks for the best criterion distinguishing malingering from factitious disorder. While secondary gain (option A) is a classic distinguishing feature, the DSM-5 and standard psychiatric teaching emphasize that the core distinction is the motivation: malingering involves external incentives (e.g., financial gain, avoiding duty), whereas factitious disorder involves assuming the sick role for psychological needs. However, both disorders involve intentional symptom production (option B), which is a shared feature, not a distinguishing one. The keyed answer (A) is not the single best answer because option B is explicitly stated in diagnostic criteria as a common element, not a discriminator. The most precise, defensible best answer from the options given is actually A, but the rationale incorrectly labels B as merely intentional production, which is inaccurate—it is a necessary criterion for both. The item's logic is flawed because it asks for 'specific criterion best distinguishes' but keys the motivation (A) while including the intentionality (B) as a distractor, creating ambiguity.
