Verdict: Correct best answer. Key stem clues: 6-year-old, CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizer, codeine post-tonsillectomy, FDA contraindication, high risk of respiratory depression. The question asks for the most critical monitoring parameter in first 24 hours. Continuous pulse oximetry provides real-time detection of hypoxemia, which is the earliest sign of opioid-induced respiratory depression; intermittent respiratory rate checks (A) can miss episodes; pain scores (C) are unrelated; sedation scores (D) are less reliable and only hourly for 8 h; capnography (E) is more sensitive but not standard of care and limited to 12 h. Thus B is uniquely best. No internal contradictions. Medical accuracy: aligns with FDA warning and consensus that continuous pulse oximetry is recommended for high-risk pediatric patients receiving opioids.
