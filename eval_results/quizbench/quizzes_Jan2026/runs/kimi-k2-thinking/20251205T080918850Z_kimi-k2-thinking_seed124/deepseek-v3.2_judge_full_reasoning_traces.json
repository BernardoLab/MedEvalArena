Key stem clues: chronic progressive sleep dysfunction with dream enactment (RBD), nocturnal stridor, daytime somnolence, gait instability, cognitive decline, polysomnography showing both non-REM parasomnias and RBD, normal CSF, and mild cerebellar atrophy on MRI. This constellation is highly specific for anti-IgLON5 disease, a recently defined tauopathy. The other antibodies are associated with distinct syndromes: Anti-Hu (limbic encephalitis), Anti-Yo (paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration), Anti-Ma2 (diencephalic/limbic encephalitis), and Anti-NMDA receptor (acute encephalitis with psychiatric features and CSF pleocytosis). No logical contradictions or missing critical details. Medical accuracy is sound.

Key stem clues: irregular bleeding 18 months post-delivery, mildly elevated hCG (150 mIU/mL), intrauterine mass, biopsy showing sheets of intermediate trophoblasts with eosinophilic cytoplasm, low mitotic index, strong hPL positivity, and hCG negativity. These features are classic for placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT). The item is logically valid; the findings uniquely point to PSTT. The other options are less consistent: choriocarcinoma and invasive mole have high hCG and stain for hCG; epithelioid trophoblastic tumor is very rare and has distinct histology; persistent mole is a molar pregnancy.

Key stem clues: Danon disease with severe HCM, multiple accessory pathways, pre-excited AF refractory to medical therapy, and recurrent syncope. The logical issue is that the provided key (D, heart transplant evaluation) is not the single best answer. The most appropriate next step, based on the acute presentation of drug-refractory, pre-excited AF with syncope, is urgent catheter ablation (B) to eliminate the accessory pathways and prevent sudden death, even if recurrence is possible. Transplant evaluation is a later, disease-modifying consideration. The main medical accuracy issue is the rationale's overstatement of ablation futility and understatement of its acute necessity. Minimal fix: Change the key to B, or adjust the stem to specify end-stage heart failure to justify D.\",\n  \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n  \"logical_validity\": false,\n  \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n  \"3\"\n}",

Key stem clues: natalizumab >30 months, JCV index >1.5, subacute cognitive decline, new non-enhancing white matter lesions, CSF JCV PCR positive—all diagnostic for natalizumab-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). The question asks for the most critical intervention to improve survival. The keyed answer (plasma exchange) is the standard-of-care immediate action to rapidly remove natalizumab and reduce PML progression/IRIS risk. Alternatives are incorrect: continuing/switching immunosuppression (A, B) worsens risk; mirtazapine/mefloquine (D, E) are unproven adjuncts, not critical survival interventions.
