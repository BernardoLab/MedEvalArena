He has developed gait instability and mild cognitive decline. Polysomnography reveals non-REM parasomnias and REM sleep behavior disorder. CSF studies are normal, and brain MRI shows mild cerebellar atrophy. Which antibody is most likely associated with this syndrome?", "options": ["A) Anti-Hu antibody", "B) Anti-Yo antibody", "C) Anti-IgLON5 antibody", "D) Anti-Ma2 antibody", "E) Anti-NMDA receptor antibody"], "answer": "C", "answer_index": 2, "explanation": "Anti-IgLON5 disease is a tauopathy characterized by severe sleep dysfunction (non-REM parasomnias, REM behavior disorder), bulbar symptoms, gait instability, and cognitive decline, often with normal CSF and nonspecific MRI findings. Anti-Hu and Anti-Yo are associated with limbic encephalitis and paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration respectively. Anti-Ma2 causes diencephalic syndrome, and anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis presents with psychiatric symptoms and characteristic CSF abnormalities.", "generator_model": "kimi-k2-thinking", "seed": 124, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "pred": "C", "model_outputs": "The answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251205T080918850Z_kimi-k2-thinking_seed124", "question_id": "20251205T080918850Z_kimi-k2-thinking_seed124-002", "question": "A 32-year-old woman presents with irregular vaginal bleeding 18 months after an uncomplicated term delivery. Serum hCG is mildly elevated at 150 mIU/mL. Pelvic MRI demonstrates a 4 cm intrauterine mass. Endometrial biopsy reveals sheets of intermediate trophoblastic cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, low mitotic index, and immunohistochemical staining strongly positive for hPL but negative for hCG. Which diagnosis is most likely?", "options": ["A) Choriocarcinoma", "B) Placental site trophoblastic tumor", "C) Epithelioid trophoblastic tumor", "D) Persistent hydatidiform mole", "E) Invasive mole"], "answer": "B", "answer_index": 1, "explanation": "Placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT) is a rare gestational trophoblastic disease derived from intermediate trophoblasts, characterized by hPL positivity and minimal hCG production. It presents months to years after pregnancy with mild hCG elevation and is relatively chemoresistant, often requiring hysterectomy. Choriocarcinoma and invasive mole have markedly elevated hCG and are hCG-positive on immunostain.

Electrophysiology study identifies three distinct accessory pathways. Despite maximal medical therapy, he continues to have pre-excited atrial fibrillation. What is the most appropriate next management step?", "options": ["A) Initiate flecainide therapy", "B) Perform catheter ablation of all accessory pathways", "C) Increase beta-blocker dosage", "D) Evaluate for heart transplantation", "E) Implant a dual-chamber pacemaker"], "answer": "D", "answer_index": 3, "explanation": "Danon disease causes rapidly progressive HCM, multiple accessory pathways, and skeletal myopathy with poor prognosis. Catheter ablation is often unsuccessful due to rapid pathway recurrence and progressive myocardial involvement. Beta-blockers and verapamil are contraindicated in WPW with pre-excited AF. Flecainide may transiently suppress pathways but doesn't alter disease course.
