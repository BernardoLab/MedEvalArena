Verdict: Correct best answer. This item tests immediate management of acute HeartMate 3 LVAD pump thrombosis. Key discriminating findings: plasma free hemoglobin 80 mg/dL, LDH 2,800 U/L, increased power consumption with spikes, and inflow cannula obstruction on echo—classic for mechanical hemolysis from pump thrombus. The keyed answer D (intrapump alteplase 10 mg via percutaneous catheter) is defensible as the most appropriate immediate therapy per contemporary INTERMACS protocols and HeartMate 3-specific data, offering targeted thrombolysis with high success rates. Alternatives are correctly positioned as inferior: A/B (escalating systemic anticoagulation) cannot acutely resolve established clot; C (intraventricular alteplase) lacks evidence and increases hemorrhagic stroke risk; E (emergent surgical exchange) is overly invasive for a stable patient and reserved for thrombolysis failure or hemodynamic collapse. No logical contradictions or underspecification. Medical accuracy is gold-standard: dosing, route, and risk-benefit distinctions reflect current mainstream practice.
