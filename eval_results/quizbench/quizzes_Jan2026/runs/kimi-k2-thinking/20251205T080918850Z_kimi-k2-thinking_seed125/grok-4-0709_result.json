Heparin is discontinued and argatroban initiated. The patient has significant hemolysis (plasma free hemoglobin 800 mg/dL). Which monitoring assay is most reliable for titrating argatroban in this setting?", "options": ["Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)", "Anti-Xa chromogenic assay", "Anti-IIa (thrombin) chromogenic assay", "Activated clotting time (ACT)", "Dilute Russell viper venom time (dRVVT)"], "answer": "C", "answer_index": 2, "explanation": "Anti-IIa chromogenic assay directly measures thrombin inhibition by argatroban and is least affected by hemolysis, platelet count, or factor consumption seen in ECMO. aPTT is unreliable due to factor deficiency and hemolysis. Anti-Xa assays measure anti-Xa activity, not direct thrombin inhibitors. ACT is affected by platelets and fibrinogen. dRVVT is used for lupus anticoagulant detection.", "generator_model": "kimi-k2-thinking", "seed": 125, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "pred": "D", "model_outputs": "The answer is (D)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251205T080918850Z_kimi-k2-thinking_seed125", "question_id": "20251205T080918850Z_kimi-k2-thinking_seed125-002", "question": "A 62-year-old with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma on gemcitabine presents with acute kidney injury (creatinine 3.2 mg/dL), platelet count 45,000/µL, schistocytes, LDH 2200 IU/L, and haptoglobin <10 mg/dL.

Hemodialysis is ineffective due to barium's large volume of distribution (1.5 L/kg). Oral sodium sulfate precipitates residual Ba2+ as insoluble BaSO4 in the GI tract if administered within 24 hours, preventing further absorption.

The immediate action is to stop the pump to halt further embolization, clamp the venous line to prevent additional air entry, and aspirate air from the arterial (outflow) line port. Durant's position is ineffective for venous emboli. Increasing pump flow worsens embolization. CPR is secondary to circuit management.
