Verdict: Correct best answer. Key stem clues: refractory shock (BP 70/40), bradycardia (HR 40), and massive sustained-release verapamil ingestion (10 g) establish severe calcium channel blocker toxicity requiring aggressive HIET. The question asks for optimal insulin dosing and monitoring frequency. Current toxicology guidelines (ACEP, AAPCC) recommend HIET at 1-10 units/kg/hr for severe CCB overdose, titrated to hemodynamic response, with hourly glucose monitoring to maintain euglycemia (150-200 mg/dL) via concurrent dextrose infusion. Option B matches this standard precisely. Alternatives are clearly inferior: A and C propose subtherapeutic dosing; D exceeds standard maximum (10 units/kg/hr) and emphasizes lactate over glucose; E uses acceptable dosing range but substitutes pH monitoring for the critical hourly glucose checks. No logical flaws: stem provides sufficient severity markers, options are discriminable, and key aligns with established practice.
