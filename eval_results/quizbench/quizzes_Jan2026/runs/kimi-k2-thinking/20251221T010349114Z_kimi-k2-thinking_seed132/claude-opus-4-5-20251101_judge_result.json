Captopril's 2-hour half-life is ideal for this purpose. Midodrine (A) worsens supine hypertension. Avoiding all treatment (B) risks end-organ damage from severe nocturnal hypertension. Fludrocortisone (D) exacerbates supine hypertension.

The stem describes an 89-year-old frail woman with Parkinson disease, neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (45 mmHg systolic drop), supine hypertension (185/98 mmHg), recurrent nocturnal falls, CKD stage 3b, and cognitive fluctuations on levodopa/carbidopa, donepezil, and amlodipine 5 mg. Key discriminating findings: severe orthostatic hypotension with supine hypertension, nocturnal falls, advanced age/frailty, and moderate CKD. The question asks for the most appropriate next step. Option C (bedtime captopril) addresses supine hypertension with short-acting agent timing to minimize daytime orthostatic worsening. However, Option B (discontinue amlodipine, avoid antihypertensives) is equally defensible given the patient's severe fall risk, frailty, advanced age, and cognitive impairment—populations where aggressive BP targets may cause more harm than benefit.

Verdict: Miskeyed – the correct answer should be A (Severe sarcopenia), not B. Key stem clues: grip strength 14 kg (<18 kg cutoff for women = low strength), gait speed 0.75 m/s (<1.0 m/s cutoff = low physical performance per AWGS 2019), SMI 6.8 kg/m² (>5.7 kg/m² cutoff = normal mass by BIA). Main logical issue: The rationale incorrectly states gait speed <0.8 m/s defines low performance, but AWGS 2019 uses <1.0 m/s for usual gait speed. With gait speed 0.75 m/s meeting the <1.0 m/s threshold, the patient has low strength AND low physical performance. Per AWGS 2019, confirmed sarcopenia requires low strength plus EITHER low mass OR low performance. Severe sarcopenia requires low strength plus BOTH low mass AND low performance. Since this patient has low strength + low performance but normal mass, she meets criteria for confirmed sarcopenia (B), making the key actually correct.
