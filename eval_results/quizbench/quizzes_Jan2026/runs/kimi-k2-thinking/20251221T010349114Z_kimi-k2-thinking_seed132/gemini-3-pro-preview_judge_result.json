She has recurrent nocturnal falls, CKD stage 3b (eGFR 35 mL/min), and cognitive fluctuations. Current medications include levodopa/carbidopa, donepezil, and amlodipine 5 mg daily. Which is the most appropriate next step in management?", "options": ["Discontinue amlodipine and initiate midodrine 10 mg three times daily, with last dose before 6 PM", "Discontinue amlodipine and avoid all antihypertensive therapy given fall risk", "Switch amlodipine to short-acting captopril 12.5 mg at bedtime only", "Add fludrocortisone 0.1 mg daily and continue amlodipine, elevating head of bed 30°", "Initiate droxidopa 100 mg three times daily and discontinue amlodipine"], "answer": "C", "answer_index": 2, "explanation": "Consensus guidelines for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension recommend treating supine hypertension >180 mmHg with short-acting agents at bedtime to avoid exacerbating orthostatic symptoms. Captopril's 2-hour half-life is ideal for this purpose. Midodrine (A) worsens supine hypertension. Avoiding all treatment (B) risks end-organ damage from severe nocturnal hypertension. Fludrocortisone (D) exacerbates supine hypertension. Droxidopa (E) is not first-line and offers no advantage over midodrine in this scenario.", "generator_model": "kimi-k2-thinking", "seed": 132, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "target_topic": "Geriatrics", "judge_model": "gemini-3-pro-preview", "judge_model_outputs_raw": "{\"analysis\":\"The vignette describes a patient with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) and severe supine hypertension (SH) (>180 mmHg systolic). Management guidelines prioritize removing long-acting antihypertensives (like amlodipine) which exacerbate daytime hypotension. Because the SH is severe, it requires treatment to mitigate end-organ risk, but the agent must be short-acting and administered at bedtime to avoid residual hypotensive effects upon waking. Option C correctly applies this strategy (stopping amlodipine, adding short-acting captopril at night). Options A, D, and E suggest adding pressors (midodrine, droxidopa) or volume expanders (fludrocortisone); these are contraindicated or require extreme caution in patients with uncontrolled SH of this magnitude (185/98 mmHg).
