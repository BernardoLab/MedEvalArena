She has recurrent nocturnal falls, CKD stage 3b (eGFR 35 mL/min), and cognitive fluctuations. Current medications include levodopa/carbidopa, donepezil, and amlodipine 5 mg daily. Which is the most appropriate next step in management?", "options": ["Discontinue amlodipine and initiate midodrine 10 mg three times daily, with last dose before 6 PM", "Discontinue amlodipine and avoid all antihypertensive therapy given fall risk", "Switch amlodipine to short-acting captopril 12.5 mg at bedtime only", "Add fludrocortisone 0.1 mg daily and continue amlodipine, elevating head of bed 30°", "Initiate droxidopa 100 mg three times daily and discontinue amlodipine"], "answer": "C", "answer_index": 2, "explanation": "Consensus guidelines for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension recommend treating supine hypertension >180 mmHg with short-acting agents at bedtime to avoid exacerbating orthostatic symptoms. Captopril's 2-hour half-life is ideal for this purpose. Midodrine (A) worsens supine hypertension. Avoiding all treatment (B) risks end-organ damage from severe nocturnal hypertension. Fludrocortisone (D) exacerbates supine hypertension. Droxidopa (E) is not first-line and offers no advantage over midodrine in this scenario.", "generator_model": "kimi-k2-thinking", "seed": 132, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "target_topic": "Geriatrics", "judge_model": "kimi-k2-thinking", "judge_model_outputs_raw": "{\"analysis\":\"Validity label: V (Valid). Verdict: Correct best answer. The stem’s key discriminating features are severe neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (45 mmHg drop), marked supine hypertension (185/98 mmHg) in this frail elderly patient, recurrent nocturnal falls, CKD 3b, cognitive fluctuations, and current amlodipine therapy. These point to a need for short‑acting bedtime antihypertensive therapy that does not worsen orthostatic symptoms. Option C (switch amlodipine to short‑acting captopril 12.5 mg at bedtime) aligns with consensus guidelines recommending short‑acting agents (e.g., captopril) for supine hypertension in autonomic failure. Alternatives are inferior: midodrine (A) and droxidopa (E) exacerbate supine hypertension; fludrocortisone (D) also raises supine pressure; avoiding therapy (B) risks end‑organ damage. No internal contradictions or missing critical details prevent a single best answer. Medical accuracy is high; the recommended approach reflects current standard of care, though the item omits brief mention of renal dosing considerations for captopril in CKD, which is a minor omission.
