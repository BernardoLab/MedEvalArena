She has recurrent nocturnal falls, CKD stage 3b (eGFR 35 mL/min), and cognitive fluctuations. Current medications include levodopa/carbidopa, donepezil, and amlodipine 5 mg daily.

Captopril's 2-hour half-life is ideal for this purpose. Midodrine (A) worsens supine hypertension. Avoiding all treatment (B) risks end-organ damage from severe nocturnal hypertension. Fludrocortisone (D) exacerbates supine hypertension.
