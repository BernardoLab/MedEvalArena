The vignette clearly defines a high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer patient, for whom guidelines (AUA/EAU) recommend induction BCG followed by maintenance therapy. The optimal evidence-based regimen for high-risk disease is induction plus 3-year maintenance. However, the key (D) incorrectly specifies the Connaught strain and an 8-week start for the first maintenance dose. While 3-year maintenance is correct, current major guidelines (AUA, EAU, NCCN) do not endorse one BCG strain over another as superior, and the standard maintenance schedule begins at 3 months (not 8 weeks), making option D inaccurate. Option C is the most defensible best answer, as it correctly states 'Induction plus 3-year maintenance' without the incorrect strain/schedule specifics.
