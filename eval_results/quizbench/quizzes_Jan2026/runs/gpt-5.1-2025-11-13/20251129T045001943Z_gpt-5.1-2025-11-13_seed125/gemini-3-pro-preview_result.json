Despite volume resuscitation, blood products, and endoscopic band ligation, he requires increasing vasopressor doses. Continuous renal replacement therapy is initiated for worsening azotemia and hyperkalemia. His MAP is 62 mm Hg on norepinephrine 0.24 mcg/kg/min and vasopressin 0.03 units/min. Lactate is 5.1 mmol/L; pH 7.28; ScvO2 76%. Bedside echo shows hyperdynamic LV function, small underfilled LV, and collapsible IVC. CVP is 4 mm Hg. You are considering adding a third agent. Which vasopressor strategy is most appropriate now?", "options": ["Add epinephrine infusion targeting higher MAP (70-75 mm Hg)", "Add low-dose dobutamine to improve splanchnic perfusion", "Add angiotensin II infusion while maintaining current MAP target", "Increase vasopressin above 0.04 units/min to exploit V1 receptor effect", "Switch norepinephrine to phenylephrine to minimize beta-adrenergic effects"], "answer": "C", "answer_index": 2, "explanation": "He has vasodilatory shock in advanced cirrhosis with catecholamine-resistant hypotension despite adequate volume; angiotensin II is reasonable as a third-line agent in catecholamine-refractory vasodilatory shock and has emerging use in hepatorenal-type circulatory failure. Epinephrine would increase lactate and myocardial oxygen demand without addressing RAAS dysregulation; high-dose vasopressin increases ischemia risk, phenylephrine may worsen gut perfusion, and dobutamine is not indicated with hyperdynamic LV and adequate ScvO2.", "generator_model": "gpt-5.1-2025-11-13", "seed": 125, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "pred": "C", "model_outputs": "This patient presents with decompensated cirrhosis and refractory vasodilatory shock (likely septic or SIRS-related post-hemorrhage) characterized by significant hypotension despite high-dose norepinephrine and vasopressin. The key physiologic features are a hyperdynamic left ventricle, low systemic vascular resistance (distributive shock), and high lactate with high ScvO2 (impaired oxygen extraction or shunting).\n\n1.  Hemodynamic Goals: In patients with acute variceal hemorrhage or cirrhosis, the target Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) is typically maintained between 60-65 mm Hg. Targets significantly higher than this (e.g., >70 mm Hg) increase portal pressure and the risk of rebleeding.\n2.  Assessment of Current Status: The patient is on norepinephrine (0.24 mcg/kg/min) and vasopressin (0.03 units/min) with a MAP of 62 mm Hg. This MAP is acceptable given the bleeding risk, but the shock is refractory (increasing doses required, elevated lactate). The echo shows a hyperdynamic, underfilled LV. While the standard physiologic answer for an underfilled LV is volume resuscitation, the prompt implies that despite resuscitation, pressors are needing escalation.\n3.  Evaluating Options:\n    *   Option A (Add Epinephrine, target MAP 70-75): While epinephrine is a standard third-line agent in septic shock, targeting a MAP of 70-75 mm Hg is contraindicated in this patient due to the high risk of variceal rebleeding. Furthermore, epinephrine increases lactate levels (via aerobic glycolysis), which can confound the clinical picture in a patient with liver failure.\n    *   Option B (Add Dobutamine): Dobutamine is an inotrope/vasodilator. This patient has a *hyperdynamic* LV (supranormal contractility) and low blood pressure. Dobutamine would worsen the hypotension (vasodilation) and is unnecessary for contractility.\n    *   Option C (Add Angiotensin II, maintain MAP target): Angiotensin II (ATII) is approved for refractory vasodilatory shock (ATHOS-3 trial). Patients with cirrhosis and vasodilatory shock often have high levels of endogenous vasodilators and may be refractory to catecholamines but responsive to ATII (or have relative angiotensin deficiency/downregulation). Crucially, this option specifies \"maintaining current MAP target,\" which aligns with the safety requirement to prevent rebleeding (MAP ~60-65 mm Hg).\n    *   Option D (Increase Vasopressin > 0.04): Vasopressin doses > 0.03-0.04 units/min are associated with significant risks of coronary and mesenteric ischemia and skin necrosis. While vasopressin is beneficial for lowering portal pressure, exceeding the standard shock dose is generally not recommended as a primary strategy over adding a new agent.\n    *   Option E (Switch to Phenylephrine): Phenylephrine is a pure alpha-agonist that increases afterload but decreases cardiac output. In a patient with high lactate (tissue hypoperfusion), reducing cardiac output is generally undesirable unless severe tachycardia or dynamic obstruction is present. Norepinephrine is superior for mortality in distributive shock.\n\nConclusion: Adding Angiotensin II is the most appropriate escalation for refractory vasodilatory shock in this context, provided the MAP target remains conservative to protect against recurrent variceal hemorrhage.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed125", "question_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed125-002", "question": "A 63-year-old woman with a history of JAK2-positive polycythemia vera treated with hydroxyurea for 9 years presents with 3 months of progressive fatigue, 7-kg weight loss, early satiety, and drenching night sweats.

In the context of MF, monosomy 7 and complex karyotypes are \"unfavorable\" to \"very high risk\" markers, predicting rapid progression to leukemic transformation and shorter overall survival.\n\nManagement Analysis:\n*   Intermediate-2 and High-risk Myelofibrosis: The median survival is relatively short (approx. 4 years for Int-2, less for High, and significantly less with high-risk cytogenetics).\n*   Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HCT): This is the only curative therapy for myelofibrosis. Current guidelines (e.g., NCCN, ELN) recommend that patients with Intermediate-2 or High-risk disease who are transplant candidates (generally aged < 70-75 without prohibitive comorbidities) should be evaluated for HCT. This patient is 63 and fits the criteria.\n*   Ruxolitinib (JAK inhibitor): While Ruxolitinib is effective for reducing spleen size and managing constitutional symptoms (and is often used *prior* to transplant as a bridge), reliance on it as the sole strategy (\"defer further planning\") is inappropriate for a candidate with high-risk cytogenetics (monosomy 7). Delaying the transplant workup risks loss of the curative window due to disease progression or transformation to AML.\n*   Hydroxyurea (A): The patient has progressed while on this agent; increasing the dose is unlikely to control the fibrotic progression or high-risk biology.\n*   Azacitidine (D): Hypomethylating agents are sometimes used for blastic progression or patients ineligible for other therapies, but HCT is the priority for a fit 63-year-old.\n*   Interferon (E): Typically used for low-risk or early-stage disease, not advanced fibrotic disease with high-risk genetics.\n\nTherefore, because the patient has high-risk disease and is a candidate for the only curative modality, the most appropriate next step is to initiate the evaluation for transplantation.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed125", "question_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed125-003", "question": "A 28-year-old G1P0 woman at 33 weeks' gestation presents to the ED with acute dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and near syncope.

Indication for Reperfusion: The presence of hemodynamic instability (shock) is the primary indication for reperfusion therapy (thrombolysis or embolectomy) in addition to anticoagulation. Heparin alone (Option D) is insufficient for massive PE because it does not actively dissolve the clot burden causing the obstruction and RV failure.\n2.  Pregnancy and Thrombolysis: While pregnancy increases the risk of bleeding complications (including placental abruption), it is a relative, not absolute, contraindication to thrombolysis. In the setting of life-threatening shock (\"save the mother to save the fetus\"), maternal stabilization takes precedence.\n3.  Choice of Modality:\n    *   Systemic Thrombolysis (Option A): This is the standard of care for massive PE with hemodynamic instability when there are no absolute contraindications (e.g., active bleeding, history of hemorrhagic stroke). It allows for the most rapid restoration of pulmonary perfusion. Alteplase (tPA) is the most commonly used and studied agent (typically 100 mg administered over 2 hours).\n    *   Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis (CDT) (Option B): While CDT uses lower doses of thrombolytics and carries a lower bleeding risk, it requires time to mobilize the team and perform the procedure. In a patient with active hypotension/near-syncope, the delay makes this less suitable than immediate systemic administration. CDT is often preferred for intermediate-high (submassive) risk PE or if systemic lysis is contraindicated.\n    *   Surgical Embolectomy (Option C): This is typically reserved for cases where thrombolysis is absolutely contraindicated or has failed. It requires cardiopulmonary bypass, which carries a high risk of fetal loss and is logistically complex to arrange immediately.\n    *   Tenecteplase (Option E): While used in STEMI and studied in intermediate-risk PE, Alteplase is the currently recommended and FDA-approved agent for systemic thrombolysis in PE. The regimens for Tenecteplase in PE are less universally engaged in guidelines compared to the standard Alteplase infusion.\n\nTherefore, immediate administration of systemic thrombolysis is the most appropriate management to prevent maternal cardiovascular collapse.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed125", "question_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed125-004", "question": "A 4-year-old boy is brought to the PICU with progressive leg weakness and refusal to walk for 5 days after a viral upper respiratory infection.

Indication for Surgery: Brain abscesses larger than 2.5 cm, especially those causing mass effect or neurological deficits, require surgical intervention (decompression and obtaining culture) in addition to antibiotics. Medical management alone (Option E) is inappropriate for a lesion of this size with focal deficits.\n2.  Aspiration vs. Excision:\n    *   Timing/Pathology: The patient has a 10-day history of symptoms. In the evolution of a brain abscess, this corresponds to the early capsule stage (early capsule formation typically occurs around days 10–13). At this stage, the capsule is thin and not well-formed.\n    *   Procedure of Choice: Stereotactic needle aspiration (Option A) is the standard of care for most brain abscesses, particularly in the early stages or when they are deep/eloquent. It allows for decompression and identification of the pathogen with lower morbidity than open surgery.\n    *   Risks of Excision: Open craniotomy with complete excision (Option B) is generally reserved for multiloculated abscesses, fungal infections, traumatic abscesses containing bone chips, or those that fail aspiration.

IV Alteplase Contraindication: IV alteplase is contraindicated in patients taking direct factor Xa inhibitors (like rivaroxaban) who have received a dose within the last 48 hours or have elevated anticoagulant markers (such as an anti-Xa level >30-50 ng/mL or relevant coagulopathy). Administering IV alteplase in the setting of full anticoagulation carries a prohibitively high risk of intracranial hemorrhage (Option A is incorrect).\n\n2.  Reversal Agents: The safety and efficacy of administering reversal agents (such as andexanet alfa or PCCs) specifically to enable the administration of IV alteplase in acute ischemic stroke have not been established. There are concerns regarding pro-thrombotic risks and a lack of randomized trial data supporting this practice (Options B and D are incorrect).\n\n3.  Mechanical Thrombectomy: Mechanical thrombectomy is the standard of care for patients with large vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation who are eligible. In patients who are ineligible for IV alteplase (e.g., due to active anticoagulation), proceeding directly to mechanical thrombectomy is the recommended strategy (Option C is correct).\n\n4.  Deferral: Deferring reperfusion is inappropriate because the patient has a salvageable penumbra and a treatable occlusion (Option E is incorrect).\n\nTherefore, the best management is to bypass IV thrombolysis and proceed immediately to mechanical thrombectomy.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed125", "question_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed125-009", "question": "A 22-year-old man with sickle cell disease (HbSS) presents with high fever, cough, and pleuritic chest pain.

Status of the Patient: The patient is deteriorating. He has increasing oxygen requirements (from 2 L/min to 8 L/min) and worsening radiographic findings (near-complete whiteout). This classifies as severe ACS.\n2.  Hemoglobin Level: The patient's hemoglobin is currently 10.3 g/dL. In sickle cell disease, increasing hemoglobin above 10–11 g/dL via simple transfusion significantly increases blood viscosity. Hyperviscosity can exacerbate vaso-occlusion and worsen end-organ monitoring, potentially leading to stroke or further lung injury. Therefore, further simple transfusion (Option A) is contraindicated.\n3.  Role of Exchange Transfusion: Reducing the percentage of Hemoglobin S (HbS) containing red blood cells is crucial to stop the cycle of sickling, acute lung injury, and hypoxia. Red blood cell exchange transfusion (erythrocytapheresis) is the treatment of choice for severe ACS, especially when the hemoglobin is already high enough (often >9–10 g/dL) to preclude simple transfusion or when there is rapid clinical deterioration. The goal is typically to lower HbS levels to <30%.\n4.  Other Options:\n    *   Corticosteroids (Option C): While steroids may reduce inflammation, they are associated with a high risk of rebound vaso-occlusive pain crises and readmission. They are not the standard of care for life-threatening ACS compared to exchange transfusion.\n    *   Anticoagulation (Option D): Pulmonary embolism is a differential, but the clinical picture fits progressive ACS. While fat emboli are a component of ACS, therapeutic anticoagulation is not the primary treatment for the sickling crisis itself without a confirmed diagnosis of thromboembolic PE.\n    *   Intubation (Option E): While mechanical ventilation may become necessary for respiratory failure, it is a supportive measure. The underlying pathology (sickling in the pulmonary vasculature) must be addressed. Deferring the transfusion intervention would be a mistake as the disease process is advancing. Exchange transfusion should be initiated promptly to potentially prevent intubation or improve outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate next step is to perform an exchange transfusion to replace sickle RBCs with normal RBCs, lowering the HbS percentage without increasing viscosity dangerous levels.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed125", "question_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed125-010", "question": "A 58-year-old man with alcohol-related cirrhosis and portal hypertension is admitted with confusion and generalized tonic-clonic seizures.

Key features supporting this diagnosis include:\n1.  Cirrhosis: Predisposes the patient to altered pharmacokinetics and hepatic encephalopathy.\n2.  Labs: High ammonia (96 µmol/L) and low carnitine. VPA inhibits the urea cycle (specifically carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I) and depletes carnitine, leading to hyperammonemia even in the absence of frank liver failure (though this patient has liver dysfunction).\n3.  VPA Levels: The *total* VPA level is therapeutic, but the *free* VPA level is supratherapeutic. In cirrhosis, hypoalbuminemia (reduced protein binding) leads to a higher fraction of free (active/toxic) drug, even if total levels appear normal.\n4.  EEG: Triphasic waves are characteristic of metabolic encephalopathy (specifically hepatic) rather than active seizure activity (epileptiform discharges).\n5.  Clinical Status: Confusion and asterixis are consistent with encephalopathy.\n\nManagement Strategy:\n*   Discontinue Valproic Acid: It is the offending agent causing hyperammonemia and toxicity. Continued use in cirrhosis is generally ill-advised due to hepatotoxicity and these metabolic complications.\n*   Start Levetiracetam: This is the preferred antiepileptic drug (AED) in patients with severe liver disease. It has minimal protein binding, does not induce hepatic enzymes, and is primarily excreted renally, making its pharmacokinetic profile predictable and safe in this context.\n*   L-Carnitine Supplementation: This is the specific antidote for VPA-induced hyperammonemia and carnitine deficiency. It facilitates the mitochondrial metabolism of VPA and reduces ammonia levels.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n*   A & E: Continuing VPA, even at a lower dose or with rifaximin, does not address the VPA-specific toxicity (high free fraction and mitochondrial toxicity/carnitine depletion).\n*   C: Phenytoin is highly protein-bound and hepatically metabolized. Its management in cirrhosis is difficult due to altered protein binding (similar to VPA) and zero-order metabolism kinetics, presenting a high risk of toxicity.\n*   D: Adding topiramate does not address the underlying toxicity and may contribute to cognitive dulling.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}]
