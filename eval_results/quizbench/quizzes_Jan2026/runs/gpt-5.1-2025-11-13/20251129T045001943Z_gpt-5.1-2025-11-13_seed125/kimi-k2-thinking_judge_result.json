Verdict on keyed answer: Correct best. Key stem clues that drive a unique best answer include: WNT-activated molecular subtype with CTNNB1 mutation and monosomy 6, non-metastatic staging, near-total resection, and age >3 years. These features collectively define standard-risk medulloblastoma per COG/SIOP criteria, mandating reduced-dose craniospinal irradiation (23.4 Gy) with posterior fossa boost plus chemotherapy (option C) to maintain >90% survival while minimizing neurocognitive and endocrine toxicity. Each distractor is appropriately incorrect: A represents high-risk overtreatment; B's focal RT alone ignores CSF dissemination risk; D's observation is unsafe despite favorable biology; E's CSI omission is investigational and non-standard. No main logical issues exist—the item is internally consistent with no contradictions or missing critical details. No main medical accuracy issues exist—the content reflects 2024 consensus guidelines precisely.
