Verdict: Correct best answer. The stem describes a euthymic bipolar I patient on stable mood stabilizers (lithium + quetiapine) who develops new-onset OCD with significant functional impairment. Key discriminating findings: (1) 18-month mood stability, (2) clear OCD symptoms with insight, (3) functional impairment requiring intervention, (4) normal thyroid/renal function confirming lithium safety. The clinical problem is managing new OCD in stable bipolar disorder while minimizing mood destabilization risk. Option D (CBT with ERP while continuing current medications) is the uniquely defensible best answer: ERP is first-line for OCD with strong evidence, carries zero mood-switching risk, and preserves the stable mood regimen. Option A (high-dose fluoxetine) poses mania risk even with mood stabilizers and is premature before trying ERP. Option B (discontinue lithium for clomipramine) abandons proven mood stability for a higher-risk TCA. Option C (increase quetiapine, avoid antidepressants) lacks evidence for quetiapine efficacy in OCD and delays appropriate treatment. Option E (switch to risperidone) has no superior OCD evidence and disrupts stable regimen unnecessarily. The item correctly prioritizes evidence-based, risk-minimizing management.
