This pattern is classic for type 2A or 2B von Willebrand disease in a patient undergoing major surgery (laparoscopic hysterectomy).\nThese findings indicate that DDAVP may be ineffective (type 2A) or contraindicated due to risk of thrombocytopenia and worsening vWF function (type 2B). Thus, a plasma-derived vWF/FVIII concentrate provides predictable replacement of vWF and factor VIII and is guideline-supported for major surgical prophylaxis in type 2 VWD.\nOption analysis: A is not preferred in suspected type 2A/2B because of unpredictability and type 2B risk.
