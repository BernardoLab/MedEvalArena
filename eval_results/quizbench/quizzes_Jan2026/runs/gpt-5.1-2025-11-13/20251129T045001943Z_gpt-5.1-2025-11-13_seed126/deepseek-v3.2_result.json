The goal is to control severe vasculitis rapidly while suppressing viral replication to prevent further immune complex deposition. Plasma exchange helps remove immune complexes, corticosteroids control inflammation, and antiviral therapy (e.g., entecavir) treats the underlying HBV infection.  \n\nCyclophosphamide is generally avoided initially in HBV-associated PAN because it can worsen viral replication and increase complications.
