This represents comprehensive planning.\n\nE. Elective mitral valve repair - The MR is secondary to LV dilation, not primary valve disease. Fixing the MR won't address the underlying cardiomyopathy and surgery in this setting carries high risk.\n\nBest Answer: Option D is most appropriate. With severe LV dysfunction (EF 20%) in an infant, evaluation for mechanical circulatory support (VAD) as bridge to transplant or recovery is the standard next step in definitive management planning. This allows time for potential myocardial recovery while providing support if needed.\n\nThe answer is (D)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed126", "question_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed126-008", "question": "A 29-year-old woman at 36+1 weeks with known SLE (class IV lupus nephritis in remission on azathioprine and hydroxychloroquine) presents with 3 days of severe frontal headache, visual blurring, and increasing lower extremity edema.

In preeclampsia, complement levels are typically normal or elevated, and active sediment with RBC casts is not characteristic.\n\nHowever, she also has severe features concerning for preeclampsia:\n- Severe headache\n- Visual symptoms\n- Severe hypertension\n\nManagement Considerations:\n\n- At 36+1 weeks, the fetus is late preterm with good viability\n- Option A (immediate delivery): Would be appropriate for preeclampsia with severe features, but doesn't address the lupus flare\n- Option C (IV methylprednisolone): Addresses the lupus flare while continuing pregnancy with monitoring\n- Option D: Delays delivery but doesn't address the underlying lupus flare\n- Option E: Cyclophosphamide is contraindicated in pregnancy\n\nGiven that the serological markers (low complement, rising anti-dsDNA, active sediment) point toward lupus nephritis flare, and the patient is at 36+1 weeks (not yet term), treating the flare with IV methylprednisolone while closely monitoring is reasonable. This can help differentiate between lupus flare and preeclampsia, and potentially allow the pregnancy to continue safely.\n\nHowever, if this were purely preeclampsia with severe features at 36+ weeks, delivery would be indicated.
