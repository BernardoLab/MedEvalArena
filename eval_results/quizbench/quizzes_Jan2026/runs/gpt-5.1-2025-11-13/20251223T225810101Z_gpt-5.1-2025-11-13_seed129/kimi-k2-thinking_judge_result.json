The stem provides a classic presentation of a deep infiltrative dermatofibroma (DPDF): a slowly enlarging, firm, skin‑colored nodule on the dorsal hand, dermoscopic whitish structureless areas with arborizing telangiectasias, and histology showing a poorly circumscribed, bland spindle‑cell proliferation with storiform pattern, infiltration between collagen bundles, factor XIIIa positivity, CD34 negativity, and low mitotic activity.

In functionally critical areas such as the hand, Mohs micrographic surgery offers tissue‑sparing complete margin assessment, which is the most effective strategy to minimize recurrence. Alternative options are inferior: 4‑mm wide excision (A) is too narrow for an infiltrative lesion; adjuvant radiotherapy (C) and observation (D) are not indicated for a benign but infiltrative tumor; systemic imatinib (E) targets DFSP‑associated PDGFR mutations and is inappropriate for a CD34‑negative lesion.

Verdict: Correct best answer. Key clues: chronic L5 radiculopathy confirmed by EMG, MRI showing no compressive pathology (small disc contacting but not compressing nerve), failure of multiple conservative modalities including epidural steroids, and surgical exclusion. These findings indicate neuromodulation for refractory neuropathic pain. Spinal cord stimulation (C) has robust evidence for improving pain/function and reducing opioid use in chronic radiculopathy without surgical target. Alternative analysis: Intrathecal opioids (A) are later-line due to infection/medication risks; pulsed DRG RF (B) has less durable evidence than SCS; facet RF (D) targets facet-mediated axial pain, not radiculopathy; percutaneous decompression (E) requires compressive disc pathology, which is absent. No logical contradictions exist—the L4 root mention describes a non-compressive incidental finding while L5 radiculopathy is the clinical target.
