The author suggests dermatofibroma with infiltrative features, but the clinical presentation (6-month enlarging firm nodule, dermoscopic arborizing telangiectasias, infiltrative growth to deep margin) strongly suggests dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) despite atypical immunophenotype. Standard DFSP is CD34+/FXIIIa-, making this case diagnostically ambiguous. The stem lacks definitive histologic diagnosis. Key issue: Without knowing whether this is DFSP (requires wide excision with 2-3cm margins per guidelines, making Mohs reasonable for hand preservation) versus atypical dermatofibroma (typically benign, observation often acceptable), the best management cannot be determined. If DFSP: both A (wide excision) and B (Mohs) are defensible; Mohs is preferred for cosmetically/functionally sensitive sites like hands.

The question asks for the most appropriate interventional procedure. Option C (spinal cord stimulation) is the keyed answer and is defensible: SCS has Level I evidence for chronic radicular pain refractory to conservative care, improves function, and reduces opioid requirements. Option A (intrathecal pump) is reserved for later-line therapy due to infection risk, tolerance, and complications. Option B (pulsed RF of DRG) has emerging but less robust evidence compared to SCS for radiculopathy. Option D (facet RF) targets facetogenic pain, not radiculopathy—the stem clearly indicates radicular pathology. Option E (nucleoplasty) requires significant disc herniation with compression; the stem explicitly states no clear compressive pathology. No logical flaws; the stem provides sufficient detail to select SCS as the single best answer. Medical accuracy is high; aligns with current pain management guidelines prioritizing neuromodulation before intrathecal opioids.

Verdict: Correct best answer. The stem describes a 46-year-old with chronic L5 radiculopathy, failed conservative management, and no surgical candidacy due to lack of clear compressive pathology (MRI shows disc \"contacting but not compressing\" nerve root). Key discriminating findings: (1) chronic neuropathic radicular pain, (2) failed multimodal conservative therapy, (3) not a surgical candidate, (4) goal to minimize long-term opioid use.
