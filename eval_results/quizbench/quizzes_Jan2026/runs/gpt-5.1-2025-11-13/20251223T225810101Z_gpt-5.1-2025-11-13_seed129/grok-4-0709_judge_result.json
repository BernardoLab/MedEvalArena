These drive toward neuromodulation for refractory neuropathic radicular pain to improve function and minimize opioids. Main logical issue(s): None; stem allows unique best answer despite minor mismatch in MRI level (L4 contact vs. L5 symptoms), as focus is on non-surgical L5 radiculopathy management. Main medical accuracy issue(s): Minor clinical unrealistic aspect in MRI describing L4 root contact without explaining L5 radiculopathy, but overall aligns with guidelines (e.g., SCS evidence in chronic radicular pain per neuromodulation societies); other options appropriately eliminated (A risks, B limited data, D for facet pain, E lacks indication). Minimal fix: Revise MRI to 'contacting but not compressing the traversing L5 nerve root' for consistency. Clinical problem: Best interventional procedure for refractory chronic L5 radiculopathy without surgical target. Discriminating findings: L5-specific EMG changes, no compression, failed multi-modal care. Implied: Neuropathic pain management via neuromodulation. Keyed C fits: SCS trials show pain relief, function gains, opioid reduction in such cases. Alternatives: A later-line with tolerance/dependence risks; B variable efficacy for DRG; D targets axial facet pain, not radiculopathy; E for compressive disc pathology, absent here.\",\n  \"medical_accuracy_score\": 4,\n  \"logical_validity\": true,\n  \"logical_false_reason\": \"T\"\n}", "judge_output_valid": true, "judge_parse_error": null, "judge_json": {"analysis": "Validity label: V. Verdict: Correct best. Key stem clues: Chronic left L5 radiculopathy per history and EMG, failed conservative management (PT, NSAIDs, epidurals, neuropaths), MRI with mild L4-L5 DDD and small foraminal protrusion contacting but not compressing exiting L4 root (not explaining L5 involvement), no surgical candidacy due to lack of compressive pathology, severe pain limiting function despite optimizations.
