After an eclamptic seizure, the priority is to prevent further seizures and control severe hypertension. Magnesium sulfate is the first-line therapy for seizure prevention in eclampsia, and guidelines recommend starting maintenance infusion after the loading dose. Immediate blood pressure control with a safe antihypertensive like IV labetalol or hydralazine is also indicated, but magnesium should be continued.  \n\n- **A** is correct: an additional 2-g bolus may be considered if seizures recur, but the mainstay is starting maintenance magnesium infusion (not listed explicitly, but starting IV labetalol for severe hypertension is appropriate after loading dose). However, in practice, after a loading dose, maintenance magnesium infusion is started, and IV labetalol is given for BP control. Since the question says she already received 4 g IV loading dose, the immediate next step is to start maintenance magnesium infusion and control BP. Option A says “administer an additional 2-g IV magnesium bolus and start IV labetalol” — this fits with giving more magnesium if seizure recurs (which it just did) and starting antihypertensive.  \n- **B** (propofol, head CT first) is not appropriate as eclampsia is the clear cause; imaging can wait.  \n- **C** (levetiracetam, discontinue magnesium, emergent C-section) is wrong because magnesium should not be stopped; delivery is indicated but not necessarily emergent C-section immediately while she’s unstable; BP control and seizure prophylaxis come first.  \n- **D** (nicardipine targeting <120/80) is too aggressive a BP target in pregnancy; aim for 140–150/90–100 to maintain placental perfusion. Also, delaying delivery 48 hours is not appropriate in eclampsia.  \n- **E** (diazepam, oral labetalol later) is incorrect because benzodiazepines are not first-line for eclampsia, and oral meds are not appropriate for acute severe hypertension post-seizure.  \n\nGiven eclampsia guidelines, after initial loading dose and a seizure, you should give another bolus of magnesium if seizure recurs (which it did, though it stopped, sometimes a second bolus is given per protocol) and begin antihypertensive therapy.

He had a pain crisis 2 weeks ago treated with IV opioids and hydration. Temperature is 38.3°C, HR 120/min, BP 96/58 mm Hg. Hip exam reveals extreme pain with any passive motion, especially internal rotation, and the leg is slightly flexed and externally rotated. WBC 18,000/µL, CRP 14 mg/dL, ESR 86 mm/h. Plain radiograph is unremarkable. MRI of the pelvis obtained within 6 hours of symptom onset shows bone marrow edema of the femoral head and neck with a moderate hip joint effusion, but no definite abscess or cortical destruction. Which is the most appropriate next step?", "options": ["Treat as vaso-occlusive crisis with IV opioids and observe for 24-48 hours", "Start broad-spectrum IV antibiotics and schedule urgent surgical hip drainage", "Obtain radionuclide bone scan to differentiate infarction from osteomyelitis", "Repeat pelvic MRI with contrast in 72 hours before deciding on surgery", "Start IV antibiotics and aspirate the hip joint under ultrasound guidance"], "answer": "E", "answer_index": 4, "explanation": "In children with sickle cell disease, distinguishing osteomyelitis/septic arthritis from bone infarction is challenging; fever, high inflammatory markers, inability to bear weight, and effusion demand prompt evaluation. Joint aspiration with culture, ideally under ultrasound guidance, plus empiric IV antibiotics is the appropriate next step to diagnose or exclude septic arthritis early. Delaying for observation or repeat imaging risks joint destruction; bone scan is nonspecific in this setting, and immediate surgical drainage without diagnostic aspiration may be premature without frank clinical sepsis.", "generator_model": "gpt-5.1-2025-11-13", "seed": 127, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "pred": "A", "model_outputs": "t be a
