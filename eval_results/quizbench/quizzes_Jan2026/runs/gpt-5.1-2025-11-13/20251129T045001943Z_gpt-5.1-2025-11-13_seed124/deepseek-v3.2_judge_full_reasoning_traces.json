Key stem clues: first-trimester pregnancy, intractable nausea/vomiting, severe acute liver injury (elevated AST/ALT, coagulopathy, encephalopathy), absence of other acute liver failure etiologies on initial workup, and failure to improve with supportive care. The item logically points to hyperemesis gravidarum leading to acute liver failure, where immediate termination of pregnancy is a recognized life-saving intervention. No internal contradictions exist; the keyed answer (urgent uterine evacuation and N-acetylcysteine) is the single best, guideline-supported step. Medical accuracy is sound: acute liver failure in early pregnancy with hyperemesis is an indication for pregnancy termination to reverse the process. Minor nuance: N-acetylcysteine is not universally standard for non-acetaminophen acute liver failure in pregnancy, but its use is plausible. Minimal fix: none required for logical validity; to enhance precision, specify 'acute liver failure due to hyperemesis gravidarum' in the rationale.\",\n  \"logical_false_reason\": \"T\",\n  \"logical_validity\": true,\n  \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n  \"4\"\n}",

The keyed answer (C) contradicts the explicit recommendation from neurosurgery, who advises against surgery due to high risk (severe cardiomyopathy, active drug use) and recommends medical therapy unless deterioration. The stem states surgery is high risk and neurosurgery recommends medical therapy, making C indefensible as the 'most appropriate next step' given the presented information. The best answer is likely A (continue IV vancomycin with monitoring) as it aligns with the specialist recommendation and the absence of acute deterioration. The main logical issue is miskeying; the stem explicitly contradicts the key. Medical accuracy is sound regarding the severity of the condition, but the key ignores the provided risk assessment. Minimal fix: Change the key to A, or revise the neurosurgery recommendation to align with urgent surgery if that is the intended teaching point.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n

Key stem clues: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) with progressive visual loss despite acetazolamide and weight loss. The vignette describes unilateral nondominant transverse sinus narrowing, not thrombosis, and progressive vision loss despite medical therapy. The most appropriate next step for vision-threatening IIH refractory to medical therapy is typically optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF) or CSF diversion (shunt). However, the provided key (D) is ONSF, which is a valid option, but ventriculoperitoneal shunt (A) is also a valid and commonly accepted next step in this scenario, and the vignette does not provide sufficient detail to uniquely favor ONSF over shunt. Both are guideline-supported interventions for refractory IIH with vision loss, leading to ambiguity. The item is miskeyed because the stem does not justify D as the singular best answer over A. Minimal fix: Specify a contraindication to shunt (e.g., 'patient refuses invasive intracranial procedure') or a specific indication for ONSF (e.g., 'headaches are well-controlled, but visual fields are worsening') to make D uniquely best.\",\n  \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n  \"logical_validity\": false,\n  \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n  \"4\"\n}",

Key stem clues: Endemic Lyme region, prior erythema migrans, progressive myelopathy with leptomeningeal enhancement, elevated CSF Lyme antibody index, and CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis with elevated protein. The clinical picture is Lyme meningomyelitis. The standard of care for Lyme neuroborreliosis with CNS parenchymal involvement (myelitis) is IV ceftriaxone for 2-4 weeks. However, in severe spinal cord inflammation with significant neurologic deficits, adjunctive high-dose corticosteroids are often used empirically to reduce inflammation while antibiotics treat the infection, despite lack of robust trial data. Option C (IV ceftriaxone plus steroids) is a defensible best answer in this severe, progressive case, making the provided key (B, antibiotics alone) not uniquely best. Main logical issue: Key mismatch. Main medical accuracy issue: The keyed answer (B) is not incorrect, but option C is equally or more appropriate given the severity.

Key stem clues: RA-ILD with UIP pattern on HRCT, subacute dyspnea, low DLCO, and current methotrexate/TNF inhibitor therapy. The logical issue is that while discontinuing methotrexate is a standard, evidence-based step in this scenario, the stem does not provide a clear, unique reason to switch to rituximab over other ILD-favorable biologics (e.g., abatacept, tocilizumab) or to choose it over adding an antifibrotic like nintedanib. The keyed answer (B) is a reasonable option but not uniquely defensible as 'most appropriate' without additional clinical context (e.g., progressive fibrosis, joint activity).
