However, AFLP typically occurs in the third trimester.\n\nGiven the:\n- First trimester timing\n- Markedly elevated β-hCG\n- Hyperthyroid state\n- Severe hepatic dysfunction with encephalopathy\n\nThis is most consistent with severe hyperemesis gravidarum complicated by acute liver failure, possibly associated with a molar component or simply severe HG.

This is life-threatening.\n\nManagement Options Analysis:\n\nA. Methylprednisolone - Not indicated for this condition; waiting for serologies is inappropriate given deterioration\n\nB. Uterine evacuation + N-acetylcysteine - This addresses the underlying cause (pregnancy-related liver failure) and provides hepatoprotection.

The plan is IV thrombolysis (tPA) followed by mechanical thrombectomy.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\nOption A: IV unfractionated heparin before thrombectomy\nThis is contraindicated. Anticoagulation should not be given within 24 hours of IV thrombolysis due to increased bleeding risk. Heparin is not routinely used before or during thrombectomy.\n\nOption B: IV labetalol to reduce BP to <140/90 mm Hg before thrombolysis\nFor IV thrombolysis, the BP target is <185/110 mm Hg (not <140/90). Lowering BP too aggressively (<140/90) could compromise cerebral perfusion, especially with a large vessel occlusion. This is incorrect.\n\nOption C: Start high-dose statin and delay antiplatelet therapy until 24 hours after thrombolysis\nThis is correct practice. High-intensity statin therapy should be initiated early in acute ischemic stroke. Antiplatelet therapy (aspirin) should be delayed for 24 hours after IV thrombolysis to reduce hemorrhagic transformation risk. This follows current guidelines.\n\nOption D: Dual antiplatelet therapy immediately after thrombolysis\nThis is dangerous. Antiplatelet therapy should be withheld for 24 hours after tPA. Giving DAPT immediately would significantly increase hemorrhagic risk.\n\nOption E: Intra-aortic balloon pump preemptively\nThis is not indicated. IABP is used for cardiogenic shock, not for stroke management. His cardiac function, while reduced, doesn't warrant this intervention, and it wouldn't improve cerebral perfusion in this context.\n\nThe correct answer is C - starting a high-dose statin is appropriate acute management, and delaying antiplatelet therapy for 24 hours after thrombolysis is standard of care per AHA/ASA guidelines.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed124", "question_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed124-003", "question": "A 34-year-old woman with SLE (malar rash, arthritis, class III lupus nephritis on biopsy) on mycophenolate and low-dose prednisone presents with 3 months of progressive exertional dyspnea and dry cough.

Escalate mycophenolate + high-dose prednisone without further diagnostics - This is reasonable as the clinical picture strongly suggests lupus-related ILD. The BAL showing lymphocytic predominance supports inflammatory/autoimmune etiology. Both NSIP and OP in SLE respond to immunosuppression.\n\nB. Switch to cyclophosphamide + list for transplant - Too aggressive. No evidence of end-stage disease, and transplant listing is premature.\n\nC. Surgical lung biopsy - While this could distinguish OP from NSIP, both conditions in SLE are treated with immunosuppression. The risk of surgical biopsy in an immunosuppressed patient may not be justified when treatment would be similar.\n\nD. Add rituximab at same mycophenolate dose - Adding rituximab without first optimizing steroids is not standard approach.\n\nE. Nintedanib for progressive fibrosing ILD - Antifibrotics are considered for progressive fibrotic ILD despite immunosuppression. This patient hasn't had a trial of adequate immunosuppression yet, and there's no honeycombing suggesting established fibrosis.\n\nBest Answer:\nThe patient has active lupus (serologically) with likely lupus-associated ILD. The appropriate first step is to intensify immunosuppression. While surgical biopsy could provide histologic diagnosis, the clinical-radiological picture is consistent with inflammatory ILD (NSIP or OP), and both respond to steroids/immunosuppression.

However, methotrexate may also potentially worsen or contribute to ILD progression. Many experts recommend discontinuing methotrexate in patients with significant ILD.\n\n2. Adalimumab (TNF inhibitor): TNF inhibitors have variable effects on ILD - some reports suggest they may worsen ILD in certain patients.\n\n3. Rituximab: Has shown benefit in RA-ILD and is often preferred over other biologics in patients with significant ILD. It's considered relatively lung-safe and may even help stabilize ILD.\n\n4. Nintedanib: FDA-approved for progressive fibrosing ILD, including RA-ILD with progressive phenotype. However, it's an antifibrotic, not a disease-modifying agent for RA itself.\n\n5.
