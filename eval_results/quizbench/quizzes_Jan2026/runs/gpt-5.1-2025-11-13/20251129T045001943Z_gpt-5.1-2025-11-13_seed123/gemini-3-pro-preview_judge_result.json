Verdict: Correct best answer. The vignette describes a patient with severe COPD and persistent hypercapnia (PaCO2 58 mmHg) evaluated 3 weeks after an acute hypercapnic exacerbation requiring NIV. This specific clinical presentation aligns with the inclusion criteria of the landmark HOT-HMV trial and ERS/ATS guidelines, which support the initiation of long-term home noninvasive ventilation (NIV) to reduce readmissions and mortality. The patient also exhibits classic symptoms of nocturnal hypoventilation (morning headaches, hypersomnolence), reinforcing the indication for NIV. Option B is the correct best answer. Option A is incorrect because the patient is already adequately oxygenated (PaO2 70 mmHg), and further increasing oxygen may worsen hypercapnia via the Haldane effect and V/Q mismatch.
