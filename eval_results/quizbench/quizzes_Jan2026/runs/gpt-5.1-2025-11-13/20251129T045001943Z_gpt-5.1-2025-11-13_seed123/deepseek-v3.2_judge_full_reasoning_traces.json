Key stem clues: severe functional tricuspid regurgitation (TR) with right heart failure signs (JVP 15 cm, v waves, abdominal swelling), RV dysfunction (low TAPSE, RVFAC), preserved sinus rhythm, non-revascularizable CAD, and prohibitive surgical risk (low LVEF, NYHA III, not a transplant candidate). The item frames a patient with advanced heart failure and secondary TR where guideline-directed medical therapy is optimized but symptoms persist. The logical flow is consistent: surgical options (A, C) are high-risk given poor RV reserve; device therapy (D) is not indicated in sinus rhythm; and further neurohormonal blockade (E) is unlikely to reverse severe structural TR. Transcatheter repair (B) is the evidence-based, guideline-supported next step for symptomatic severe functional TR in inoperable patients. Medical accuracy is high, aligning with current heart failure and interventional cardiology consensus. Minimal fix: none required; the item is well-constructed.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"T\",\n    \"logical_validity\": true,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n

Key stem clues: first generalized tonic-clonic seizure, normal MRI, EEG with generalized spike-and-wave and photoparoxysmal response, subsequent generalized tonic-clonic seizures preceded by awakening myoclonic jerks—classic for juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). Patient is a young adult planning conception and wants to avoid cognitive side effects. The most appropriate monotherapy for JME in a patient of childbearing potential is lamotrigine, not levetiracetam. Lamotrigine is guideline-recommended first-line for JME in women and men of reproductive age due to efficacy for generalized seizures and myoclonus, favorable teratogenic profile, and minimal cognitive impact. Levetiracetam, while effective and with a good cognitive profile, is often second-line due to psychiatric side effects and less robust evidence as first-choice monotherapy for JME. The keyed answer (levetiracetam) is not the single best answer; lamotrigine is superior given the clinical context. Main logical issue: key mismatch.

The key stem clues are hypoglycemia with low C-peptide, inappropriately normal insulin, and undetectable ketones.

The miskey label arises because the item's logic is internally contradictory: the rationale correctly explains why A is correct, but the key is listed as A, making it correct, not miskeyed. The primary logical failure is a contradiction (C) between the item's stated key and its own explanation. The medical content is accurate (Score 4).

Key stem clues: Massive saddle PE, refractory PEA arrest after 10 minutes of ACLS with no ROSC, bedside echo showing RV strain. The clinical scenario describes a patient in cardiac arrest from massive PE, a condition where systemic thrombolysis is a standard, guideline-recommended intervention during CPR. The most appropriate next step, per ACLS guidelines and major society consensus (e.g., AHA, ESC), is the administration of systemic thrombolysis (e.g., alteplase) during ongoing CPR. Option A is the correct best answer. Option B (VA-ECMO) is a resource-intensive salvage therapy, not the immediate 'most appropriate next step' in this context, especially as the stem states they were 'preparing for systemic thrombolysis' when arrest occurred. The item is medically accurate in describing ECMO as a potential bridge, but it miskeys the answer by prioritizing an advanced rescue modality over the guideline-indicated, immediately available pharmacologic intervention. Minimal fix: Change the keyed answer to A and adjust the rationale to align with current ACLS/PE management guidelines.\",\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \"4\",\n    \"logical_validity\": false,\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\"\n}",

Key stem clues: Progressive proximal weakness, Gottron papules, mechanic's hands, and high-resolution CT findings of interstitial lung disease (ILD) with a severely reduced DLCO and FVC/DLCO ratio >1.6 suggest an inflammatory myopathy with associated ILD. The question specifically asks for the autoantibody indicating the highest risk of rapidly progressive ILD requiring aggressive early immunosuppression. Among the options, anti-MDA5 is strongly and specifically associated with rapidly progressive, often fatal ILD in dermatomyositis, even with mild muscle disease, which matches the clinical urgency implied. The other antibodies are associated with different phenotypes: anti-Jo-1 with more indolent ILD, anti-Mi-2 with classic dermatomyositis and good prognosis, anti-SRP with necrotizing myopathy, and anti-TIF1-γ with malignancy risk. No logical contradictions or underspecification exist; the vignette provides sufficient detail for a unique best answer. Medical accuracy is sound. Minimal fix: None required; the item is clear and accurate.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"T\",\n    \"logical_validity\": true,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n

Key stem clues: acute BRAO in a patient with paroxysmal AF on appropriate-dose apixaban, normal MRI/DWI, and no large-vessel disease. The vignette presents a patient with a retinal artery occlusion (a form of ischemic stroke) while on therapeutic anticoagulation for AF. Current guidelines (e.g., AHA/ASA) recommend evaluating for mechanism, but for a patient with AF and an acute ischemic stroke while on a DOAC, the standard is to ensure adherence and consider switching anticoagulant class (e.g., to warfarin) or checking drug levels, not simply continuing the same regimen. The keyed answer (C) contradicts this standard. Option B (switch to warfarin) is a more defensible best answer per major guidelines for breakthrough stroke on a DOAC. Main logical issue: key mismatch. Main medical accuracy issue: keyed answer is inconsistent with standard management. Minimal fix: Change the key to B and adjust rationale to reflect guideline-concordant management of breakthrough stroke on DOAC.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n    \"logical_validity\": false,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \"2\"\n}",

Key stem clues: severe sympathomimetic toxidrome (hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypertension, mydriasis, agitation, positive amphetamines) with benzodiazepine failure. The most appropriate next pharmacologic intervention for refractory, life-threatening sympathomimetic toxicity with hyperthermia is rapid sequence intubation and sedation with a barbiturate or propofol, not dexmedetomidine. Dexmedetomidine (keyed answer D) is a poor choice for severe, refractory agitation and hyperthermia as it provides insufficient sedation and lacks anti-hyperthermic properties. Option A (dantrolene) is incorrect as rigidity is absent, but it is a more plausible consideration for refractory hyperthermia than dexmedetomidine. The item is medically inaccurate in its keyed management. Minimal fix: Change the key to reflect the standard of aggressive sedation with propofol or a barbiturate, or add that option.\",\n  \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n  \"logical_validity\": false,\n  \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \"2\"\n}",
