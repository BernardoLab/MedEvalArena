His symptoms are refractory to medical management, including diuretics.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Surgical tricuspid valve replacement with bioprosthesis: While surgical TR repair/replacement can be considered in severe TR, it is typically performed in conjunction with left-sided valve surgery or in patients undergoing cardiac surgery for other reasons. Isolated surgical TR repair in a patient with significant comorbidities and a low LVEF might carry a high surgical risk and may not be the most appropriate first-line intervention given the availability of less invasive options.\n\nB. Catheter-based edge-to-edge tricuspid valve repair: This option, such as the MitraClip system adapted for tricuspid regurgitation (e.g., TriClip), is a less invasive approach to treat severe TR. It has shown benefit in reducing TR severity, improving symptoms, and reducing hospitalizations in carefully selected patients who are not surgical candidates or have high surgical risk. Given the patient's symptoms despite medical therapy and his comorbidities, this is a strong contender.\n\nC. Isolated LV assist device implantation: An LVAD is primarily indicated for severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction and heart failure refractory to medical therapy, typically in patients with LVEF < 25-35% who are candidates for advanced heart failure therapy. While this patient has a low LVEF, his primary symptomatic driver appears to be severe TR and RV dysfunction, not solely LV dysfunction. An LVAD alone might not adequately address the RV failure and severe TR.\n\nD. Upgrade to CRT-D with AV node ablation: CRT is indicated for patients with reduced LVEF and intraventricular conduction delay (e.g., LBBB). While CRT can improve LV function and potentially RV function in some cases, it is not a direct treatment for severe TR. AV node ablation is typically considered in patients with atrial fibrillation and a rapid ventricular response to improve symptoms, which is not the case here as the patient is in sinus rhythm.\n\nE. Intensification of neurohormonal blockade with sacubitril/valsartan uptitration: Sacubitril/valsartan is a cornerstone therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. While optimizing medical therapy is important, the patient has already been optimized with diuretics and remains symptomatic. The severe TR is a significant contributor to his symptoms and is unlikely to be fully resolved by further neurohormonal blockade alone, although it may provide some benefit.\n\nConsidering the patient's severe functional TR, RV dilation and dysfunction, NYHA class III symptoms despite optimized medical therapy, and his status as not a heart transplant candidate, catheter-based tricuspid valve repair offers a less invasive and potentially effective strategy to address the primary driver of his symptoms and improve outcomes.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed123", "question_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed123-002", "question": "A 41-year-old woman presents with progressive exertional dyspnea and chest tightness.

The severe pulmonary hypertension with a normal left ventricle and preserved RV function, along with the elevated PVR, points towards pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension. The normal V/Q scan rules out chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). The family history of sudden death in a young sibling raises suspicion for heritable PAH. The positive vasoreactivity testing with inhaled nitric oxide indicates that the patient is a responder, which is a crucial factor in guiding therapy.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. High-dose amlodipine monotherapy: While calcium channel blockers (CCBs) can be effective in a subset of PAH patients who are vasoreactive, they are typically initiated at lower doses and titrated. High-dose amlodipine monotherapy is not the most appropriate initial *combination* therapy for a responder with severe PAH.\n\nB. Combination therapy with ambrisentan and tadalafil: This represents a current guideline-recommended initial therapy for patients with PAH who are vasoreactive and have a low to intermediate risk of mortality. Ambrisentan is an endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA), and tadalafil is a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (PDE5i). This combination targets multiple pathways involved in PAH pathogenesis and has demonstrated efficacy in improving exercise capacity and reducing clinical worsening.\n\nC. Intravenous epoprostenol monotherapy: Epoprostenol is a prostacyclin analogue and is typically reserved for patients with severe PAH, high-risk features, or those who do not respond adequately to oral therapies. While effective, it is associated with significant side effects and requires continuous intravenous infusion, making it less ideal as an *initial* therapy for a vasoreactive patient who can likely be managed with oral medications.\n\nD. Riociguat monotherapy: Riociguat is a stimulator of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) and is approved for both inoperable CTEPH and WHO Group 1 PAH. While it can be used as monotherapy or in combination, the current guidelines often favor initial combination therapy with an ERA and a PDE5i for vasoreactive PAH patients.\n\nE. Warfarin with target INR 3.0-4.0: Anticoagulation is recommended for most patients with PAH, but it is an adjunct therapy and not the primary treatment for pulmonary hypertension itself. The target INR of 3.0-4.0 is generally for specific conditions like mechanical heart valves or certain thrombotic events, and a lower target INR (2.0-3.0) is typically recommended for PAH. Furthermore, it is not the *most appropriate initial long-term therapy* for the underlying PAH.\n\nGiven the patient is a vasoreactive responder with severe PAH, initial combination therapy with an ERA and a PDE5i is the most appropriate approach according to current guidelines.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed123", "question_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed123-003", "question": "A 27-year-old man presents with a first generalized tonic-clonic seizure.

The history of myoclonic jerks on awakening is particularly important. The patient also desires to avoid cognitive side effects and plans for conception.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Valproate: While effective for many seizure types, valproate has significant teratogenic risks and can cause cognitive side effects. Given the plans for conception, it's not the first choice.\n\nB. Levetiracetam: Levetiracetam is generally well-tolerated with a relatively low risk of cognitive side effects compared to some other AEDs. It is effective for generalized seizures, including myoclonic seizures. While there are some concerns regarding mood and behavior, cognitive impairment is less common. It is also considered relatively safe in pregnancy, although not entirely without risk.\n\nC. Carbamazepine: Carbamazepine is primarily effective for focal seizures and is not typically the first-line treatment for generalized epilepsy with myoclonic jerks.

Lamotrigine: Lamotrigine is effective for generalized seizures and is often a good choice for patients concerned about cognitive side effects. It is also considered one of the safer AEDs in pregnancy. However, it has a risk of rash, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, which requires slow titration. Given the myoclonic jerks, it's a strong contender.\n\nE. Topiramate: Topiramate can cause significant cognitive side effects (word-finding difficulties, slowed thinking) and is associated with teratogenic risks, including cleft lip/palate. It is not ideal for a patient concerned about cognition and planning conception.\n\nConsidering the patient's presentation of generalized seizures with myoclonic jerks, the desire to avoid cognitive side effects, and plans for conception, both levetiracetam and lamotrigine are strong options. However, levetiracetam is often favored for its broader efficacy in generalized epilepsies including myoclonic seizures and its generally favorable cognitive profile. While lamotrigine is also good for generalized seizures and cognition, the myoclonic jerks on awakening are a strong indicator for drugs that are effective against this specific symptom, and levetiracetam has a good track record here. The risk of rash with lamotrigine also necessitates careful titration. Levetiracetam's side effect profile, particularly regarding cognition, makes it a very appropriate choice.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed123", "question_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed123-004", "question": "A 55-year-old woman with a 10-year history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes presents with episodic confusion, sweating, and palpitations occurring mostly late afternoon.

Her current medications are metformin and basal insulin, and her continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) shows multiple daytime hypoglycemic episodes despite insulin dose reduction. She denies sulfonylurea use or alcohol.\n\nThe supervised 48-hour fast is a crucial diagnostic test for hypoglycemia. During the fast, her plasma glucose dropped to 42 mg/dL, which is hypoglycemic. At this point, her insulin level was 6 μU/mL (within the normal range of 2-10 μU/mL), but her C-peptide was low (0.1 ng/mL, normal 0.1-0.4 ng/mL). A low C-peptide in the presence of hypoglycemia indicates that the insulin is exogenous, not produced by the patient's own pancreas. The undetectable beta-hydroxybutyrate and negative sulfonylurea/meglitinide screen further support the absence of endogenous ketone production or the use of oral hypoglycemic agents. The normal CT of the pancreas rules out an insulinoma.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Factitious hypoglycemia from exogenous insulin analog use: This is highly consistent with the findings. The low C-peptide in the setting of hypoglycemia strongly suggests exogenous insulin administration. The episodic nature and timing (late afternoon) could be related to the pharmacokinetics of an insulin analog, and the CGM data showing daytime hypoglycemia despite reduced basal insulin supports this.\n\nB. Insulinoma with intermittent secretion: An insulinoma is a pancreatic tumor that secretes insulin. If it were an insulinoma, we would expect a high C-peptide level in conjunction with elevated insulin during hypoglycemia, indicating endogenous insulin production. The low C-peptide rules this out.\n\nC. Non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia due to IGF-2 secretion: Tumors that secrete insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) can cause hypoglycemia. However, in this scenario, the insulin and C-peptide levels would typically be suppressed, and IGF-2 levels would be elevated. While the C-peptide is low, the insulin level is within the normal range, and there's no mention of IGF-2 levels. More importantly, the low C-peptide points directly to exogenous insulin.\n\nD. Autoimmune insulin receptor activating antibody syndrome: This syndrome involves antibodies that stimulate the insulin receptor, leading to hypoglycemia. In this condition, endogenous insulin and C-peptide levels are usually suppressed due to feedback inhibition, but the hypoglycemia is caused by the antibody's action. While the C-peptide is low, the insulin level is not suppressed, and the pattern is more suggestive of exogenous insulin administration.\n\nE. Post-bariatric surgery hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia: This condition typically occurs after gastric bypass surgery and is characterized by excessive insulin secretion in response to meals, leading to reactive hypoglycemia. While the patient has diabetes, there is no mention of bariatric surgery. Furthermore, the low C-peptide is not typical of this condition, which involves endogenous hyperinsulinemia.\n\nGiven the low C-peptide in the presence of hypoglycemia and normal pancreatic imaging, the most likely diagnosis is factitious hypoglycemia due to exogenous insulin analog use. The patient may be administering insulin covertly.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed123", "question_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed123-005", "question": "A 49-year-old man with poorly controlled hypertension and obesity presents with sudden severe dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain.

Despite 10 minutes of ACLS, there is no ROSC. The question asks for the most appropriate next step.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Administer full-dose systemic alteplase as a bolus during CPR: While thrombolysis is indicated for massive PE, administering it as a bolus during CPR in a pulseless patient with PEA might not be the most effective or safest immediate next step, especially after prolonged CPR without ROSC. The risk of bleeding complications is also a concern.\n\nB. Initiate venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) followed by catheter-directed thrombectomy: In a patient with massive PE and cardiac arrest, VA-ECMO can provide hemodynamic support and oxygenation, buying time for definitive treatment like catheter-directed thrombectomy or surgical embolectomy. This approach addresses the underlying cause (PE) while supporting circulation. Given the pulselessness and PEA, mechanical circulatory support is a critical consideration.\n\nC. Administer half-dose systemic alteplase and continue CPR for at least 30 minutes: While reduced-dose thrombolysis might be considered in certain situations, the standard approach for massive PE with cardiac arrest is full-dose thrombolysis if feasible and indicated. Continuing CPR for an extended period without ROSC and without addressing the underlying cause or providing circulatory support might not be the most effective strategy.\n\nD. Terminate resuscitation efforts due to poor prognosis: While the prognosis for PEA after prolonged CPR is poor, the underlying cause is a massive pulmonary embolism, which is potentially reversible with appropriate interventions. Terminating resuscitation immediately without considering advanced interventions for the specific cause might be premature.\n\nE. Perform emergency surgical pulmonary embolectomy without ECMO: Surgical embolectomy is a definitive treatment for massive PE, but it is a highly invasive procedure. In a pulseless patient with PEA, initiating ECMO first to stabilize the patient and facilitate the transfer to a surgical suite for embolectomy might be a more appropriate and safer approach, especially if immediate surgical availability is a concern or if the patient is too unstable for immediate transfer to surgery. However, ECMO followed by thrombectomy (catheter-directed or surgical) is a well-established strategy for PE cardiac arrest.\n\nConsidering the patient is pulseless with PEA due to a massive PE, the most aggressive and potentially life-saving next step would be to initiate mechanical circulatory support (VA-ECMO) to restore perfusion and oxygenation, followed by definitive treatment to remove the clot.

The ABG shows persistent hypercapnia (PaCO2 58 mm Hg) and a compensated metabolic alkalosis (HCO3- 33 mEq/L), consistent with chronic CO2 retention. Overnight oximetry confirms sustained hypoventilation.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Increasing long-term oxygen therapy to maintain PaO2 >80 mm Hg: While oxygen therapy is crucial for hypoxemia in COPD, excessively high oxygen can worsen hypercapnia by removing the hypoxic drive to breathe and increasing dead space ventilation. The goal of oxygen therapy in COPD is typically to maintain PaO2 between 55-60 mm Hg or SaO2 >88%. Aiming for PaO2 >80 mm Hg is not indicated and could be detrimental.\n\nB. Start nocturnal noninvasive ventilation with targeted normalization of PaCO2: Nocturnal noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is indicated in patients with chronic hypercapnia and respiratory failure who remain symptomatic despite optimal medical therapy. It helps to unload the respiratory muscles, improve gas exchange, and reduce the work of breathing during sleep. The goal is to normalize or significantly reduce the PaCO2, which should alleviate the daytime somnolence and morning headaches. This is a well-established treatment for improving mortality and quality of life in such patients.\n\nC. Add chronic low-dose oral prednisone: Oral corticosteroids are generally reserved for patients with frequent exacerbations and significant airway inflammation. They are not indicated for chronic management of hypercapnia and somnolence in the absence of ongoing inflammation or frequent exacerbations. Long-term oral steroid use also carries significant side effects.\n\nD. Begin acetazolamide at night to stimulate ventilation: Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that can stimulate ventilation by inducing a metabolic acidosis. However, it is not a first-line treatment for chronic hypercapnia in COPD and can have side effects. NIV is a more direct and effective method for ventilatory support.\n\nE. Switch to high-flow nasal cannula at home during sleep: High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) can provide some level of positive airway pressure and humidification, but it is generally not as effective as NIV in providing ventilatory support for significant chronic hypercapnia and hypoventilation. NIV is specifically designed to assist ventilation and reduce the work of breathing.\n\nGiven the patient's persistent symptoms of chronic hypercapnia, daytime somnolence, and morning headaches despite optimal medical management, nocturnal NIV is the most appropriate next step to improve mortality and quality of life.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed123", "question_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed123-008", "question": "A 59-year-old man with a history of MI and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation presents with acute-onset right eye visual loss described as a \"curtain\" descending over 10 minutes, now partially improved.

He has a history of MI and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and is already on apixaban, a direct oral anticoagulant (DOA), for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. The question asks about the most appropriate management strategy regarding his antithrombotic regimen.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Continue apixaban and add aspirin 81 mg daily indefinitely: Adding aspirin to a DOAC for secondary stroke prevention is generally not recommended unless there is a specific indication for dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), such as recent ACS or stenting. In this case, the BRAO is likely due to an embolic source from his atrial fibrillation, which is already being treated with apixaban. Adding aspirin would increase bleeding risk without clear added benefit for this specific type of event.\n\nB. Switch apixaban to warfarin with target INR 2.5-3.5: Warfarin is an older anticoagulant. DOACs like apixaban have been shown to be at least as effective and often safer than warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, with less monitoring required. There is no indication to switch from apixaban to warfarin in this scenario.\n\nC. Continue apixaban at the same dose without change: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which is a strong indication for anticoagulation to prevent embolic strokes. The BRAO is an embolic event. Since he is already on apixaban at an appropriate dose for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, and there is no evidence of inadequate anticoagulation or a need for a different agent, continuing the current regimen is a reasonable approach. The BRAO itself does not automatically necessitate a change in the established anticoagulation for his underlying atrial fibrillation.\n\nD. Increase apixaban dose to 10 mg twice daily for 1 month, then 5 mg twice daily: The dose of apixaban is typically adjusted based on renal function and age/weight, not based on the occurrence of a BRAO. The standard dose for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation is 5 mg twice daily (or 2.5 mg twice daily for those with specific contraindications). Increasing the dose without a clear indication would increase bleeding risk.\n\nE. Discontinue anticoagulation and use dual antiplatelet therapy for 90 days: Discontinuing anticoagulation in a patient with atrial fibrillation and a history of MI would significantly increase the risk of further embolic events, including stroke. DAPT is typically used for secondary prevention after ACS or PCI, not as a replacement for anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation.\n\nGiven the patient's atrial fibrillation and the embolic nature of the BRAO, continuing his current effective anticoagulation with apixaban is the most appropriate strategy. The BRAO is a consequence of his underlying condition, which is being managed.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$."}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed123", "question_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed123-009", "question": "A 46-year-old man presents with sudden severe tearing chest pain radiating to the back.

Immediate TEVAR to prevent late aneurysmal degeneration: While TEVAR is an option for complicated type B dissections, immediate intervention solely for the prevention of late aneurysmal degeneration in an uncomplicated dissection is not the standard of care. The dissection is currently stable and controlled.\n\nB. Open surgical repair of the descending thoracic aorta due to renal artery involvement: Open surgical repair for type B dissections is typically reserved for cases with malperfusion, rupture, or intractable symptoms that cannot be managed medically. While there is renal artery involvement, the true lumen is still perfusing the kidney, albeit narrowed, and the creatinine has only slightly increased from baseline. There is no frank malperfusion of the kidney or other organs. Furthermore, open repair of the descending thoracic aorta carries significant morbidity and mortality and is not the first-line treatment for uncomplicated type B dissections.\n\nC. Strict medical therapy with anti-impulse control and serial imaging: This is the cornerstone of management for uncomplicated Stanford type B aortic dissections. The goals are to control blood pressure and heart rate to reduce shear stress on the aortic wall, thereby preventing further propagation of the dissection and promoting false lumen thrombosis. The patient's blood pressure is now controlled, and there are no immediate signs of complications. Serial imaging is crucial to monitor for any progression or development of complications.\n\nD. Prophylactic left renal artery stenting plus medical therapy: While the left renal artery origin is involved, the kidney is still perfused, and there is no definitive evidence of significant renal ischemia requiring immediate intervention. Prophylactic stenting without clear evidence of malperfusion is not indicated. The primary issue is the dissection itself, and addressing the dissection with medical management is the priority.\n\nE. Fenestration and true lumen expansion with balloon angioplasty: Fenestration is a technique used to improve perfusion to malperfused organs by creating a communication between the true and false lumens. This is an intervention for complicated dissections with malperfusion, which this patient does not have.\n\nGiven the absence of rupture, malperfusion, intractable pain, or rapid expansion, the most appropriate management strategy is strict medical therapy with aggressive blood pressure and heart rate control, along with close serial imaging to monitor the dissection.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$."}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed123", "question_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed123-010", "question": "A 24-year-old man presents to the ED after being found confused and agitated.

Intravenous dantrolene: Dantrolene is primarily used for malignant hyperthermia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which are characterized by muscle rigidity. This patient does not have muscle rigidity.\n\nB. Intravenous cyproheptadine via crushed tablets: Cyproheptadine is a serotonin antagonist and antihistamine that is considered a first-line treatment for serotonin syndrome. It can help to reverse the serotonergic effects. Administering it intravenously via crushed tablets is a reasonable approach in an emergency setting.\n\nC. Intravenous nitroprusside for blood pressure control alone: While the patient has hypertension, nitroprusside is a potent vasodilator and should be used cautiously. The primary issue is the underlying syndrome, not just the hypertension. Addressing the serotonin syndrome is paramount.\n\nD. Intravenous dexmedetomidine infusion: Dexmedetomidine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that can be used for sedation and agitation. However, it does not directly address the underlying serotonergic hyperactivity. While it might help with agitation, it's not the most specific treatment for serotonin syndrome.\n\nE. Intravenous bromocriptine: Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist. While dopamine plays a role in neurotransmission, it's not the primary target in serotonin syndrome. It's more relevant in conditions like Parkinson's disease or hyperprolactinemia.\n\nGiven the clinical presentation and the options, cyproheptadine is the most appropriate pharmacologic intervention to directly address the suspected serotonin syndrome.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}]
