Key stem clues: long-standing severe atopic dermatitis treated with dupilumab (IL‑4Rα blockade); new‑onset marked peripheral eosinophilia (AEC 3 000/µL), adult‑onset asthma, transient pulmonary infiltrates, ANCA‑negative, skin biopsy showing eosinophil‑rich small‑vessel vasculitis. These findings are characteristic of an EGPA‑like eosinophilic vasculitis that has been reported as a paradoxical reaction to dupilumab. Among the options, only A directly links IL‑4/IL‑13 blockade to unopposed IL‑5‑driven eosinophil proliferation, which is the most plausible immunologic explanation. Options B–E invoke Th17, B‑cell, interferon, or IL‑31 pathways that do not explain the predominant eosinophilic phenotype. No internal contradictions; the stem provides sufficient discriminators to select a single best answer. Medical accuracy: The proposed mechanism is consistent with current case series and hypothesis that IL‑4/IL‑13 inhibition may shift the Th2 milieu, allowing IL‑5‑mediated eosinophilia. While not yet proven in prospective studies, it is the best‑fit explanation for board‑style items. No major inaccuracies.
