Key discriminating findings: age 91, EF 25%, CKD stage 4, moderate dementia, functional dependence, three recent hospitalizations, POLST specifying DNR/DNI/no ICU, recurrent candidiasis, baseline SBP ~100 mmHg. The clinical problem is whether to start SGLT2 inhibitor when cardiology recommends it for hospitalization reduction but patient has limited prognosis and comfort-focused goals. Option B correctly defers therapy, aligning with geriatric principles: time-to-benefit for SGLT2 inhibitors (months) may exceed life expectancy; hypotension risk with baseline SBP 100; recurrent candidiasis history; treatment burden conflicts with comfort goals. Option A ignores goals-of-care and prognosis inappropriately. Option C (half-dose) doesn't eliminate risks and adds complexity. Option D (replace loop diuretic) would worsen volume management in advanced HF. Option E contradicts POLST directly. Medical accuracy is high: reflects appropriate geriatric deprescribing principles and goals-concordant care.
