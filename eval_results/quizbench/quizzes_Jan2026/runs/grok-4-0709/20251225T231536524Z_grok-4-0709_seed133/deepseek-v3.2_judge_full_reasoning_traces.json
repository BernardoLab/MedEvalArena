The item asks for the next step in managing a steroid-refractory severe acute demyelinating event. Plasma exchange (PLEX) is the established rescue therapy in this scenario. The alternatives are correctly dismissed: rituximab and natalizumab are disease-modifying therapies for long-term control, not acute rescue; fingolimod is not an acute treatment and carries risks in active inflammation; repeat LP is not indicated as diagnosis is already confirmed.

The question asks for the most evidence-based adjunctive therapy to enhance functional recovery beyond standard physical therapy.
