Without knowing the specific anatomy (e.g., portal vein thrombosis, hepatic vein anomaly), the defensibility of angiographic embolization (E) versus a surgical shunt (D) or other options cannot be assessed from the vignette alone. The keyed answer (E) relies on an unstated assumption that the coronary vein is the accessible and appropriate target.

Key stem clues: metastatic breast cancer on paclitaxel, acute dyspnea/hypoxemia, CT angiography negative for PE, echocardiography shows RV strain, bone marrow biopsy shows tumor infiltration. The findings of acute RV strain without macroscopic PE in a metastatic cancer patient can fit both tumor microembolism (B) and lymphangitic carcinomatosis (C), as both can present acutely and cause hypoxemia and RV dysfunction; the provided imaging detail (CT angiography) is insufficient to discriminate, as neither typically shows large emboli. The bone marrow finding is a red herring, not directly causative. Main logical issue: Option C is a strong alternative; the stem lacks a discriminating feature (e.g., characteristic CT findings like septal thickening) to make B uniquely best. Main medical accuracy issue: Minor—lymphangitic spread can cause acute symptoms and RV strain, though often subacute. Minimal fix: Specify CT findings (e.g., 'CT shows no PE but reveals smooth interlobular septal thickening') to favor C, or specify 'CT shows no parenchymal abnormalities' to favor B.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"M\",\n    \"logical_validity\": false,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n  \"4\"\n}",

The stem describes a child with autism, recurrent staring spells/facial twitching, multifocal EEG discharges, cortical dysplasia, and a de novo mutation, but does not specify the mutation or the precise epilepsy syndrome. The rationale assumes an SCN8A-related epileptic encephalopathy, but this is not stated. Without the specific genetic diagnosis, the first-line therapy is not uniquely determined from the vignette; levetiracetam (B) is a reasonable choice for many genetic epilepsies, but valproic acid (A) is also a standard broad-spectrum first-line option for multifocal epilepsies. The keyed answer relies on an unstated assumption.

The coagulation abnormality is a distractor but does not override the anatomical localization. Option B is the single best answer.

Key stem clues: chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) on dasatinib, development of pleural effusions and fatigue, cytogenetic analysis showing additional clonal evolution. The pleural effusion is a known adverse effect of dasatinib, and clonal evolution indicates disease progression/resistance. The logical issue is miskeying: the most appropriate initial therapeutic adjustment for a dasatinib-related adverse effect (pleural effusion) with clonal evolution is typically to switch to another second-generation TKI (like nilotinib or bosutinib) or dose reduce/manage the effusion, not immediately to ponatinib, which is reserved for specific high-risk mutations (e.g., T315I) not confirmed here. The stem is underspecified regarding the specific mutation, making ponatinib a premature leap. A unique best answer exists (likely D, dose reduction for toxicity while assessing resistance), but the provided key (C) is not it. Medical accuracy issue: ponatinib is not first-line for uncharacterized clonal evolution with concurrent drug toxicity. Minimal fix: Specify the mutation (e.g., 'shows T315I mutation') to justify ponatinib, or change the key to D.\",\n  \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n  \"logical_validity\": false,\n  \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n  \"3\"\n}",

Key stem clues: acute collapse, unknown ingestion, bradycardia, hypotension, miosis (cholinergic toxidrome), and partial/transient response to atropine. This classic triad, especially with atropine's partial effect, strongly points to organophosphate/carbamate poisoning, where pralidoxime is the definitive enzyme-regenerating antidote. No logical issues; the stem supports a single best answer. Medical accuracy is sound, aligning with standard toxicology. The only minor nuance is that pralidoxime is most definitive for organophosphates, and its benefit in carbamates is debated, but the presentation is classic for organophosphate.

Key stem clues: JIA on etanercept, fever/rash/lymphadenopathy, positive viral serology, but lymph node biopsy shows clonal T-cell population. The keyed answer (E, TNF inhibitor-induced lymphoma) is a plausible consideration, but the stem's positive viral serology and clinical presentation (fever, rash, lymphadenopathy) are classic for a primary EBV infection. In a patient on immunosuppression, this creates a high risk for an EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD), which can be T-cell or NK-cell in a minority of cases. The clonality does not rule out an LPD; it supports a neoplastic process, which an EBV-LPD can be. Option B is equally, if not more, defensible given the viral serology context. Main logical issue: The stem provides data strongly supporting two distinct lymphoproliferative etiologies (viral vs. drug-induced), making a single best answer ambiguous. Main medical issue: Oversimplifies that EBV-LPD is exclusively B-cell; T-cell LPDs occur. Minimal fix: Specify the virus (e.g., 'EBV serology positive') and state PCR is for EBV-encoded RNA (EBER) to strongly anchor answer B, or remove the viral serology clue to anchor answer E.\",\n  \"logical_false_reason\": \"M\",\n  \"logical_validity\": false,\n  \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n  \"3\"\n}",
