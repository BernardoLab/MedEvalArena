Despite endoscopic intervention and octreotide infusion, bleeding persists, and he develops hemodynamic instability. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is considered, but imaging reveals a rare anatomical variant. What is the most appropriate next step in management?", "options": ["Proceed with TIPS using a covered stent to mitigate risks", "Initiate balloon tamponade with a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube", "Administer terlipressin as an alternative vasoconstrictor", "Perform urgent surgical portocaval shunt", "Refer for angiographic embolization of the coronary vein"], "answer": "E", "answer_index": 4, "explanation": "In persistent variceal bleeding with anatomical variants precluding TIPS, angiographic embolization targets specific bleeding vessels like the coronary vein, offering a less invasive option. TIPS is contraindicated due to the variant, while surgical shunts carry high mortality in unstable patients. Terlipressin and balloon tamponade are temporizing but not definitive here.", "generator_model": "grok-4-0709", "seed": 125, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "pred": "B", "model_outputs": "Balloon tamponade with a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube to temporize bleeding while preparing for definitive therapy (since TIPS is not feasible due to anatomy).\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251201T041413890Z_grok-4-0709_seed125", "question_id": "20251201T041413890Z_grok-4-0709_seed125-002", "question": "A 62-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer on paclitaxel develops acute dyspnea and hypoxemia.
