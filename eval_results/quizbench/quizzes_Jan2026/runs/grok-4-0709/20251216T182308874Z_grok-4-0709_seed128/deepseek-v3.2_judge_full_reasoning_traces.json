The question asks for long-term management to prevent recurrent complications. Option C (serial embolotherapy guided by symptoms) aligns with guideline-based stepwise management, avoiding overtreatment (A) and inappropriate anticoagulation (B). Surgical resection (D) is not first-line, and observation (E) is insufficient given symptomatic disease. No logical contradictions; the stem provides sufficient detail (genetics, symptoms, imaging) to uniquely support C. Medical accuracy is high, reflecting standard HHT care.

Key stem clues: sudden cyanosis, agitation, tachypneic, SpO2 65% in a 6-month-old with known tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) defines a hypercyanotic (\\\"tet\\\") spell. After initial non-pharmacologic measures (knee-to-chest, morphine), the next best pharmacologic intervention is a beta-blocker (e.g., propranolol or esmolol) to reduce infundibular spasm and heart rate, not a pure alpha-agonist. Main logical issue: A unique best answer exists (intravenous propranolol or esmolol), but the provided key (phenylephrine) is not it. Phenylephrine is a second-line agent if beta-blockers are ineffective or contraindicated. Main medical accuracy issue: The rationale incorrectly downplays beta-blockers and overstates the risk of epinephrine. Minimal fix: Change the key to A (intravenous propranolol) and update the rationale to reflect that beta-blockers are first-line pharmacologic therapy for acute hypercyanotic spells.\",\n

Key stem clues: The patient has both a pheochromocytoma and bilateral renal artery stenosis, requiring preoperative management for the pheochromocytoma before any surgical intervention. The presence of renal artery stenosis makes ACE inhibitors (B) and angioplasty (C) inappropriate as initial management for the pheochromocytoma. Surgery without preparation (E) is dangerous. Calcium channel blockers (D) are a second-line or adjunctive therapy, not the standard initial preoperative regimen. The standard of care for preoperative management of pheochromocytoma is nonselective alpha-blockade (e.g., phenoxybenzamine) followed by beta-blockade, making A the unique best answer. The item is logically valid and medically accurate. Minimal fix: None required; the item is clear and correct.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"T\",\n    \"logical_validity\": true,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n

Key stem clues: 28 weeks gestation, severe preeclampsia with HELLP syndrome (thrombocytopenia, elevated LFTs, hemolysis), non-reassuring fetal heart rate, and history of antiphospholipid syndrome. These findings indicate severe maternal disease and fetal compromise, making immediate delivery the definitive management. Main logical issue: None; the stem provides sufficient severity markers. Main medical accuracy issue: None; immediate delivery for severe preeclampsia/HELLP with non-reassuring status at any gestational age is standard. Minimal fix: None required; the item is clear and accurate. The explanation correctly dismisses expectant management (A) due to severity, magnesium (C) as adjunctive only, and plasma exchange (D) and steroids (E) as non-first-line.\",\n

The stem describes placental abruption with fetal bradycardia (indicating fetal distress) and DIC. The most critical initial intervention is immediate delivery to address the cause of DIC and fetal compromise, making cesarean delivery (A) the standard of care. While correcting coagulopathy (B) is essential, it is a concurrent, supportive measure, not the most critical initial step when the fetus is in distress. The item's logic incorrectly prioritizes resuscitation over definitive treatment.

Key stem clues: Sudden hypotension, tachycardia, and increased end-tidal CO2 during laparoscopic surgery with CO2 insufflation are classic for CO2 embolism, not venous air embolism. The immediate management for a gas embolism is to stop insufflation, release pneumoperitoneum, and position the patient in left lateral decubitus/Trendelenburg. The keyed answer (A) incorrectly identifies the embolic gas and suggests hyperventilation, which is not the primary intervention. Option B correctly identifies CO2 embolism but incorrectly suggests increasing insufflation pressure, which is harmful. The logical issue is miskeying; the unique best answer is not among the options as written, as both A and B contain critical errors. Main medical accuracy issue: The keyed answer and its rationale contain a dangerous inaccuracy regarding the type of embolism and management. Minimal fix: Change option A to 'CO2 embolism; stop insufflation, release pneumoperitoneum, and place patient in left lateral decubitus position' and key it as correct.\",\n

Key stem clues: refractory hypotension post-CPB, RV dilation/septal shift, elevated PA pressures—consistent with RV failure with pulmonary hypertension. The most appropriate initial pharmacologic intervention for RV failure with systemic hypotension is typically an inotrope (e.g., dobutamine) to support RV contractility and cardiac output, not a selective pulmonary vasodilator like inhaled nitric oxide as the first-line agent. Main logical issue: A unique best answer exists (B), but the provided key (A) is not it. Main medical accuracy issue: While inhaled nitric oxide is a valid adjunct for pulmonary hypertension, initiating it as the primary intervention for refractory hypotension with RV failure is not standard first-line management. Minimal fix: Change the key to B (Intravenous dobutamine) or adjust the stem to specify severe pulmonary hypertension without systemic hypotension to justify inhaled nitric oxide as the primary intervention.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n    \"logical_validity\": false,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n

Key stem clues: Complete heart block during TAVR, temporary pacing initiated, rhythm does not recover. This scenario is a classic indication for permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation, as post-TAVR heart block from conduction system injury is often permanent. Main logical issue: None; the stem clearly describes a persistent, procedure-related high-grade block. Main medical accuracy issue: None; the key aligns with standard guidelines (e.g., ACC/AHA) recommending PPM for persistent high-grade block post-TAVR. Minimal fix: None required for logical validity. To enhance clarity, the stem could specify a duration (e.g., 'rhythm does not recover after 24-48 hours') to reinforce the 'persistent' nature, but the current wording ('does not recover' intraoperatively) is sufficient for a board-style question.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"T\",\n    \"logical_validity\": true,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n
