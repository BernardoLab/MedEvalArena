Key stem clues driving the answer: PCOS/IVF (high risk), 5 days post-transfer (typical timing), massive ascites with enlarged ovaries (pathognomonic), hemoconcentration/hyponatremia (severity), dyspnea/oliguria (end-organ compromise). These establish severe OHSS requiring hospitalization. Option A (IV albumin + paracentesis) is uniquely defensible: albumin restores oncotic pressure to correct intravascular depletion, and paracentesis relieves respiratory compromise from tense ascites. Alternatives are clearly inferior: B (furosemide) worsens hypovolemia; C (heparin alone) is adjunctive; D (home expectant) is unsafe; E (detorsion) addresses wrong pathology. No contradictions. Minor logical issue: 'initial' is slightly ambiguous as crystalloids typically precede albumin, but in severe OHSS with dyspnea, albumin and paracentesis are appropriate early interventions. Medical accuracy aligns with ASRM/RCOG guidelines for severe OHSS management.
