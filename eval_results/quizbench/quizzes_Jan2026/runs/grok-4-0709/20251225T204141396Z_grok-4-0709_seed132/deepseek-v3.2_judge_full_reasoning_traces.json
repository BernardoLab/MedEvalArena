Key stem clues: history of atopic dermatitis, new biologic therapy, widespread pruritic vesicles/bullae, biopsy showing subepidermal clefting with eosinophils and flame figures, negative direct immunofluorescence. The findings are classic for bullous pemphigoid (BP), especially drug-induced BP from biologics, where negative DIF can occur early. Flame figures are nonspecific and can be seen in BP. The most appropriate next step for suspected drug-induced BP is to stop the offending drug and initiate first-line treatment, which is high-potency topical corticosteroids or systemic corticosteroids for widespread disease. Dapsone is a second-line agent for BP, not first-line. Thus, option D is uniquely defensible as best. Main logical issue: Key B does not match the single best answer.

The stem describes established heterotopic ossification (HO) causing pain and limited abduction. The question asks for the 'most effective intervention to preserve joint mobility.' For established, symptomatic HO impairing mobility, the definitive treatment to restore motion is surgical excision once the lesion is mature (typically after 12-18 months, confirmed by a quiescent bone scan). The keyed answer (B, low-dose radiation) is a prophylactic measure to prevent HO recurrence after surgery or in high-risk settings, not the primary intervention for existing, mobility-limiting HO. While indomethacin (D) is also prophylactic, and bisphosphonates (A) can slow mineralization, surgical excision (C) is the standard for restoring mobility in established, symptomatic cases. The stem lacks critical timing details (e.g., 'acute onset' or 'mature lesion') to definitively rule out surgery, but given the presentation of limited mobility, surgery is the most effective intervention. The item is medically accurate in describing radiation's role but misapplies it to the clinical scenario. Minimal fix: Change the stem to '...undergoes functional electrical stimulation therapy.

Key stem clues: Rheumatoid arthritis with secondary fibromyalgia, persistent widespread pain despite optimized pharmacotherapy, quantitative sensory testing shows central sensitization. The question asks for the advanced rehabilitation technique most likely to provide long-term benefit. The keyed answer (A, Graded motor imagery) is a plausible technique for central sensitization, but the most evidence-based, guideline-recommended, first-line non-pharmacological intervention for fibromyalgia with central sensitization is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), often combined with exercise. While graded motor imagery has emerging evidence, CBT is the established cornerstone for long-term management. Option D is 'Cognitive behavioral therapy alone,' which is a standard, effective approach. The item's rationale dismisses CBT without justification, creating a miskey. The stem does not specify failure of CBT, making D defensible. Main logical issue: Key mismatch with best-supported answer. Main medical accuracy issue: Overlooking CBT as first-line for fibromyalgia central sensitization. Minimal fix: Change key to D, or modify stem to state 'despite optimized pharmacotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy' to justify a more advanced technique like graded motor imagery.\", \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\", \"logical_validity\": false, \"medical_accuracy_score\": \t\"3\"}",
