The vignette describes Familial Hemiplegic Migraine type 1 (FHM1), confirmed by the CACNA1A mutation (P/Q-type calcium channel). The question asks for the most effective prophylactic treatment. Verapamil (a calcium channel blocker) is widely cited in medical literature and board resources as a first-line or preferred therapy for FHM1, specifically targeting the underlying channelopathy. While Topiramate and Valproate are effective for general migraine prophylaxis, Verapamil is the classic 'best answer' for this specific genetic subtype. Propranolol (beta-blocker) is traditionally considered relatively contraindicated or less preferred in hemiplegic migraine due to theoretical concerns about worsening vasoconstriction/aura, though this is debated. Amitriptyline is less specific. Therefore, Verapamil is the unique best answer among the provided options.", "medical_accuracy_score": 5, "logical_validity": true, "logical_false_reason": "T", "verdict": "PASS", "fail_reason": "NA"}, "judge_verdict": "PASS", "judge_fail_reason": "NA", "judge_medical_accuracy_score": 5}, {"quiz_id": "20251216T182308874Z_grok-4-0709_seed129", "question_id": "20251216T182308874Z_grok-4-0709_seed129-019", "question": "A 40-year-old man with HIV on antiretroviral therapy develops violaceous plaques on the legs.
