Verdict on keyed answer: Miskeyed. Key stem clues: Bosniak IV cyst (high risk of malignancy) in a patient with CKD stage 4. The primary goal is to treat the likely malignancy while preserving renal function. Main logical issue: A unique best answer exists, but the provided key (A, Partial nephrectomy) is not it. For a Bosniak IV cyst, the standard management is radical nephrectomy, as it is considered malignant until proven otherwise, and partial nephrectomy is typically reserved for smaller tumors or when preservation is critical; however, with pre-existing severe CKD, the risk of progression to dialysis must be weighed, but guidelines still favor radical nephrectomy for Bosniak IV lesions. Main medical accuracy issue: The rationale incorrectly prioritizes partial nephrectomy as the most appropriate initial management for a Bosniak IV cyst. Minimal fix: Change the key to E (Radical nephrectomy) and update the rationale to reflect guideline-concordant management of Bosniak IV cysts.\",\n  \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n  \"logical_validity\": false,\n  \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n  \"3\"\n}", "judge_output_valid": true, "judge_parse_error": null, "judge_json": {"analysis": "Validity label: K (Miskeyed).
