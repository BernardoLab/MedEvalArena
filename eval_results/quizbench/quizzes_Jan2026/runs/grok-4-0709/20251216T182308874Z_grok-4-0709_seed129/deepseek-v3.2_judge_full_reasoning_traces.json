Key stem clues: acute agitation, hallucinations, disorganized thinking after lithium discontinuation, elevated serum creatinine (1.8 mg/dL), recent NSAID use. The vignette suggests a lithium-withdrawal relapse, not acute lithium toxicity, as lithium was stopped 2 weeks ago and no lithium level is provided. The keyed answer (D, hemodialysis) is inappropriate without evidence of current lithium toxicity. The most appropriate initial management for acute agitation in this psychiatric emergency is rapid tranquilization, making E (lorazepam IV) or A (haloperidol IM) defensible, leading to secondary label M. Main logical issue: key mismatch. Main medical issue: recommending hemodialysis without indication is a significant error. Minimal fix: Change key to E or A, or rewrite stem to include a toxic lithium level and symptoms of toxicity (e.g., ataxia, confusion) to justify dialysis.\",\n  \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n  \"logical_validity\": false,\n  \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \"2\"\n}",

Key stem clues: Postoperative pseudoaneurysm after laparoscopic cholecystectomy with difficult intraoperative bleeding from the cystic artery. The most likely source is the cystic artery, a branch of the hepatic artery. Angiographic embolization is the standard, minimally invasive first-line intervention for visceral artery pseudoaneurysms, especially in a postoperative setting. Surgical re-exploration (C) is a valid alternative but carries higher morbidity and is typically reserved for unstable patients or embolization failure, making B the best answer. ERCP (A) and PTC (D) are for biliary issues, not vascular. Observation (E) is inappropriate for a known, likely symptomatic pseudoaneurysm given the risk of rupture. The item is logically valid and medically accurate. Minimal fix: None required; the item is sound.

The stem clearly describes a stable patient with a high-output enterocutaneous fistula, a classic scenario for initial non-operative management. Key stem clues are 'hemodynamically stable' and 'high-output fistula drainage,' which contraindicate immediate surgery (B) and favor measures to reduce output and promote healing. The keyed answer (A) aligns with standard guidelines: total parenteral nutrition (to provide bowel rest and nutritional support) combined with a somatostatin analog (to reduce secretory output) is the most effective first-line strategy for promoting spontaneous closure. Alternatives are correctly inferior: surgery is for refractory cases, antibiotics treat infection, hyperbaric oxygen lacks robust evidence, and fibrin glue is for low-output tracts. No contradictions or missing critical details. Medical accuracy is sound. Minimal fix: None required; the item is clear and accurate.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"T\",\n    \"logical_validity\": true,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n

Key stem clues: sudden painless vision loss, macular edema, neovascularization at the disc, and vitreomacular traction (VMT) confirmed by OCT. The findings are classic for proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) with macular edema and traction. The most appropriate initial treatment for PDR with high-risk characteristics (neovascularization at the disc) is panretinal photocoagulation (PRP), per standard guidelines. While VMT is present, the immediate threat is from the neovascularization, which PRP addresses. Vitrectomy is typically reserved for non-clearing vitreous hemorrhage or tractional retinal detachment, not as the initial step here. Main logical issue: The key (C) is not the single best answer; the unique best answer is B. Main medical accuracy issue: Prioritizing vitrectomy over PRP for initial management of active PDR is not standard. Minimal fix: Change the key to B (Panretinal photocoagulation).\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n    \"logical_validity\": false,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \"2\"\n}",

Key stem clues: progressive spastic paraparesis and urinary incontinence in a patient with known multiple sclerosis, MRI shows a syrinx from C4 to T2 without Chiari malformation. The most likely mechanism in this clinical context is a syrinx secondary to MS (inflammatory/demyelination-related), not post-traumatic, as no trauma history is provided. The keyed answer (A) is not the single best answer; option D (Inflammatory syrinx due to MS; high-dose steroids) is more defensible based on the association of syringomyelia with MS and initial anti-inflammatory management, though the efficacy of steroids for a chronic syrinx is debatable. Main logical issue: The key does not match the diagnosis most directly supported by the vignette. Main medical accuracy issue: While steroids are used in MS, their role for a chronic, progressive syrinx is not well-established; shunting (A) is a procedural option but not the most likely initial mechanism.

Key stem clues: Parkinson's disease, motor fluctuations, impulse control disorder (ICD) on pramipexole. The most appropriate adjustment should address both issues: reducing ICD risk while managing fluctuations. The keyed answer (D, apomorphine) is a dopamine agonist with high ICD risk, making it a poor choice to mitigate ICD. A unique best answer exists: switching from one oral dopamine agonist (pramipexole) to a non-oral formulation like the rotigotine patch (A) is a guideline-supported strategy to potentially reduce ICD while managing fluctuations, though risk remains. Alternatives: entacapone (B) only addresses fluctuations; DBS (C) is for advanced, refractory cases; levodopa (E) increases dyskinesia risk but is first-line for fluctuations and has lower ICD risk than agonists. Main logical issue: key mismatch. Main medical accuracy issue: apomorphine is contraindicated for ICD mitigation.
