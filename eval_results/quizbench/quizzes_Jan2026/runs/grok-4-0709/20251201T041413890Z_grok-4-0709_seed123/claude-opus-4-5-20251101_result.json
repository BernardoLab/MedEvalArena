ICD (Option A): While syncope in HCM can indicate arrhythmic risk and ICD may be considered for sudden cardiac death prevention, the primary issue here is the severe LVOT obstruction causing symptoms. ICD doesn't address the obstruction.\n\n2. Septal myectomy (Option B): This is the gold standard surgical treatment for drug-refractory obstructive HCM. It's preferred in patients who are good surgical candidates and at experienced centers.\n\n3. Alcohol septal ablation (Option C): An alternative to myectomy, typically considered for patients who are poor surgical candidates or prefer a less invasive approach. Generally considered second-line to myectomy.\n\n4. Dual-chamber pacing (Option D): Has shown limited efficacy and is not recommended as primary therapy for LVOT obstruction in current guidelines.\n\n5. Mavacamten (Option E): A cardiac myosin inhibitor approved for obstructive HCM. However, the question states the patient is on \"optimal medical therapy\" and continues to have symptoms. While mavacamten is a newer option, the traditional next step after failing beta-blockers would be septal reduction therapy.\n\nDecision:\nThe patient has:\n- Severe symptoms (recurrent syncope)\n- Severe LVOT obstruction (80 mmHg at rest)\n- Failed medical therapy\n\nAccording to guidelines, septal reduction therapy is indicated.

Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA): CAA typically causes lobar hemorrhages in the cortical and subcortical regions, particularly in the parietal and occipital lobes. It rarely affects deep structures like the thalamus, basal ganglia, or brainstem. This makes CAA less likely for a thalamic hemorrhage.\n\nB. Hypertensive vasculopathy: This is the most common cause of deep intracerebral hemorrhages, particularly affecting the basal ganglia, thalamus, pons, and cerebellum. The thalamus is a classic location for hypertensive hemorrhage. While the question mentions orthostatic hypotension, patients with Parkinson's disease often have autonomic dysfunction that can include both orthostatic hypotension AND supine hypertension. Additionally, many elderly patients have underlying hypertensive changes in their vessels.\n\nC. Levodopa-induced vasospasm: There is no well-established mechanism linking levodopa to vasospasm causing hemorrhage. This is not a recognized complication.\n\nD. Orthostatic hypotension-related watershed infarction: This would cause ischemic stroke in watershed territories, not a hemorrhagic stroke in the thalamus. This doesn't fit the presentation.\n\nE. Dopaminergic therapy-associated coagulopathy: Carbidopa-levodopa is not associated with coagulopathy or increased bleeding risk.\n\nThe thalamic location with intraventricular extension is classic for hypertensive hemorrhage. Even though the patient has orthostatic hypotension (common in Parkinson's due to autonomic dysfunction), this doesn't preclude hypertensive vasculopathy, which develops over years of blood pressure fluctuations and vessel damage.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251201T041413890Z_grok-4-0709_seed123", "question_id": "20251201T041413890Z_grok-4-0709_seed123-003", "question": "A 45-year-old man with type 1 diabetes mellitus presents with recurrent hypoglycemia despite dose adjustments.

Cosyntropin (ACTH) stimulation test - This is the standard confirmatory test for primary adrenal insufficiency. It tests the adrenal glands' ability to respond to synthetic ACTH. In primary adrenal insufficiency, cortisol will fail to rise appropriately.\n\nB. Insulin tolerance test - Used primarily to test for secondary/tertiary adrenal insufficiency and GH deficiency.
