Medical therapy with beta-blockers has failed to alleviate his symptoms.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement: An ICD is indicated for primary or secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in HCM. While recurrent syncope can be a symptom of SCD risk, the primary issue here is the hemodynamic obstruction causing symptoms. An ICD does not address the LVOT gradient.\n\nB. Septal myectomy: This is a surgical procedure to remove thickened septal muscle, which effectively reduces the LVOT gradient and relieves symptoms in obstructive HCM. It is a well-established and highly effective treatment for patients refractory to medical therapy.\n\nC. Alcohol septal ablation: This is an interventional cardiology procedure that aims to reduce the septal hypertrophy by inducing a controlled myocardial infarction. It is an alternative to surgical myectomy for the treatment of symptomatic obstructive HCM, particularly for patients who are poor surgical candidates.\n\nD. Dual-chamber pacing: While certain pacing strategies have been explored to reduce LVOT gradients, their efficacy is variable and generally less pronounced than myectomy or ablation, especially for significant resting gradients. It is not typically the first-line intervention for severe symptomatic obstruction unresponsive to medical therapy.\n\nE. Mavacamten initiation: Mavacamten is a novel cardiac myosin inhibitor specifically approved for the treatment of symptomatic obstructive HCM. It works by reducing the excessive contractility of the myofibrils, thereby decreasing the LVOT obstruction and improving symptoms. Recent guidelines (ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022) recommend myosin inhibitors (Class I; Level B) for symptomatic obstructive HCM to improve functional capacity and reduce LVOT obstruction. Given that the patient's symptoms persist despite beta-blockers, escalating to a targeted medical therapy like mavacamten represents a logical next step before considering invasive procedures, especially as it directly addresses the underlying mechanism of obstruction.\n\nConsidering the current treatment algorithms and the availability of a drug that specifically targets the mechanism of obstruction in symptomatic obstructive HCM, initiating mavacamten is the most appropriate next step. It is a less invasive option than surgery or ablation and offers a targeted medical approach for symptom relief and gradient reduction. While myectomy and alcohol septal ablation are effective, they are typically considered after medical therapies, including newer agents like mavacamten, have been optimized or proven insufficient.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{E}$."}, {"quiz_id": "20251201T041413890Z_grok-4-0709_seed123", "question_id": "20251201T041413890Z_grok-4-0709_seed123-002", "question": "A 72-year-old woman with Parkinson's disease develops sudden onset of severe headache, vomiting, and left-sided hemiparesis.

Imaging reveals a right thalamic hemorrhage with intraventricular extension. She is on carbidopa-levodopa and has a history of orthostatic hypotension. We need to identify the most likely underlying mechanism.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\nA. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA): CAA is a common cause of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage, particularly in older adults. However, CAA typically affects the cerebral cortex and subcortical white matter, leading to lobar hemorrhages. Thalamic hemorrhages are considered deep hemorrhages, and while CAA can occasionally involve deep structures, it is less common than hypertension as a cause for thalamic bleeds.\n\nB. Hypertensive vasculopathy: Long-standing hypertension is the most frequent cause of deep intracerebral hemorrhages, including those in the basal ganglia, thalamus, pons, and cerebellum. The thalamus is a typical location for hypertensive hemorrhages, often occurring due to the rupture of small arteries (e.g., lenticulostriate arteries) affected by chronic hypertension. The patient's age and the location of the hemorrhage strongly support this diagnosis.\n\nC. Levodopa-induced vasospasm: Levodopa is a dopamine precursor used to treat Parkinson's disease. While it can affect cardiovascular parameters and potentially blood pressure regulation, it is not a recognized cause of vasospasm leading to intracerebral hemorrhage. Vasospasm is more commonly associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage or certain illicit drug use.\n\nD. Orthostatic hypotension-related watershed infarction: Orthostatic hypotension, a condition where blood pressure drops significantly upon standing, can lead to cerebral hypoperfusion. This hypoperfusion can result in ischemic strokes, particularly in watershed areas (the border zones between major arterial territories). The patient's presentation is a *hemorrhage*, not an infarction. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nE. Dopaminergic therapy-associated coagulopathy: Carbidopa-levodopa therapy aims to replenish dopamine levels and does not directly cause a coagulopathy (a bleeding disorder). While certain medications can impair coagulation and increase bleeding risk, dopaminergic agents are not known to do so. Parkinson's disease itself is not typically associated with a primary coagulopathy.\n\nConsidering the location of the hemorrhage (thalamus, a deep structure) and the patient's age, hypertensive vasculopathy is the most common and therefore the most likely underlying mechanism, even though hypertension is not explicitly listed as a past medical history. The symptoms are classic for an acute intracerebral hemorrhage.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."}, {"quiz_id": "20251201T041413890Z_grok-4-0709_seed123", "question_id": "20251201T041413890Z_grok-4-0709_seed123-003", "question": "A 45-year-old man with type 1 diabetes mellitus presents with recurrent hypoglycemia despite dose adjustments.

The elevated ACTH level in conjunction with low cortisol strongly suggests primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) rather than secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency. The history of type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroiditis, and vitiligo further supports an autoimmune etiology, making autoimmune adrenalitis a likely cause.\n\nWe need to choose the most appropriate confirmatory test for this suspected diagnosis.\n\nA. Cosyntropin stimulation test (ACTH stimulation test): This is the gold standard test for confirming primary adrenal insufficiency. It measures the adrenal glands' ability to produce cortisol in response to synthetic ACTH. In primary adrenal insufficiency, the adrenal glands are damaged and cannot mount an adequate cortisol response to ACTH.\n\nB. Insulin tolerance test (ITT): This test assesses the integrity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by inducing hypoglycemia and measuring hormonal responses, including cortisol. It is useful for diagnosing ACTH deficiency (secondary/tertiary adrenal insufficiency) but is not the primary test for confirming *primary* adrenal insufficiency, and it carries significant risks, especially for patients with known adrenal insufficiency or hypoglycemia.\n\nC. 21-Hydroxylase antibody assay: This test identifies antibodies against the enzyme 21-hydroxylase, which is the primary autoantigen in autoimmune adrenalitis. While it can confirm the *cause* of primary adrenal insufficiency, it does not confirm the *presence* of adrenal insufficiency itself. The diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is functional, confirmed by hormonal response tests.\n\nD. Adrenal CT scan: A CT scan visualizes the adrenal glands and can detect abnormalities like atrophy, masses, or hemorrhage. While it can be useful in evaluating the adrenal glands, it is not a functional test to confirm adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal atrophy is typical in autoimmune adrenalitis, but the functional confirmation is crucial.\n\nE. Metyrapone test: This test assesses the pituitary's response to a decrease in cortisol by blocking cortisol synthesis. It is used to evaluate the HPA axis and is primarily utilized for diagnosing secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency. It is not the first-line test for confirming primary adrenal insufficiency.\n\nGiven the low morning cortisol and elevated ACTH, primary adrenal insufficiency is strongly suspected. The cosyntropin stimulation test directly evaluates the adrenal glands' response and is the most appropriate confirmatory test for this condition.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$."}, {"quiz_id": "20251201T041413890Z_grok-4-0709_seed123", "question_id": "20251201T041413890Z_grok-4-0709_seed123-004", "question": "A 60-year-old smoker with COPD presents with progressive dyspnea and hemoptysis.

Imaging reveals a lung nodule with mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and biopsy confirms squamous cell carcinoma. PET-CT shows no distant metastases, indicating locally advanced disease.\n\nThe presence of \"mediastinal lymphadenopathy\" strongly suggests N2 disease (ipsilateral mediastinal lymph nodes) or N3 disease (contralateral mediastinal, hilar, or supraclavicular lymph nodes). According to TNM staging, N2 disease typically confers Stage IIIA, and N3 disease confers Stage IIIB. Squamous cell carcinoma can present with locoregional spread.\n\nThe management of Stage III NSCLC depends on resectability.\n*   For resectable Stage III NSCLC (e.g., limited N2 disease, good performance status), treatment options may include induction chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery. In such cases, surgery is part of the treatment, but not necessarily the *initial* sole management.\n*   For unresectable Stage III NSCLC (e.g., bulky N2 disease making surgical resection unsafe, or N3 disease), concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is the standard of care and offers the best chance of cure.\n\nGiven the description \"mediastinal lymphadenopathy\" without explicit confirmation of resectability, it's reasonable to infer that the disease may be locally advanced and potentially unresectable by standard surgical criteria. In such scenarios, CCRT is the definitive initial management strategy aiming for cure.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA.  Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT): Primarily used for early-stage (Stage I) in medically inoperable patients, not for locally advanced disease with nodal involvement.\nB.  Surgical lobectomy with lymph node dissection: This is the treatment of choice for resectable early-stage NSCLC (Stage I/II) or selected cases of resectable Stage IIIA. However, with mediastinal lymphadenopathy, the tumor may not be resectable, or surgery might not be the immediate first step (induction therapy might precede it).\nC.  Concurrent chemoradiotherapy: This is the standard of care for unresectable Stage III NSCLC, offering definitive treatment for both the primary tumor and the locoregional nodal disease. Given the presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy, this is a strong contender.\nD.  Immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy: Typically used for Stage IV NSCLC or as adjuvant therapy after definitive treatment for resected Stage II/IIIA disease. Not the initial management for potentially curable locally advanced disease.\nE.  Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor: Targeted therapy for NSCLC with specific EGFR mutations, usually for metastatic disease (Stage IV) or in adjuvant settings, not the primary management for locally advanced SCC without known mutation status.\n\nConsidering that \"mediastinal lymphadenopathy\" often implies N2 disease, which can make a tumor unresectable, concurrent chemoradiotherapy (C) is the most appropriate initial management for a potentially curable but locally advanced NSCLC. If the disease were clearly resectable, surgery would be considered, but the presence of mediastinal nodes makes this less certain as the *initial* best step without further staging information regarding resectability.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$."}, {"quiz_id": "20251201T041413890Z_grok-4-0709_seed123", "question_id": "20251201T041413890Z_grok-4-0709_seed123-005", "question": "A 35-year-old woman in the emergency department presents with chest pain, palpitations, and diaphoresis after using cocaine.

Coronary angiography reveals a thrombus in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) as the cause, with no underlying atherosclerosis. This suggests a cocaine-induced thrombotic event leading to acute coronary occlusion.\n\nThe accepted gold standard for immediate management of STEMI is reperfusion therapy. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting is the preferred method of reperfusion when it can be performed promptly by experienced operators. In this case, angiography has already identified the occluded vessel and an intraluminal thrombus. PCI would allow for direct mechanical revascularization, thrombus removal (potentially with aspiration or thrombectomy as an adjunct), and placement of a stent to re-establish flow and prevent re-occlusion.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\nA. Intracoronary thrombolysis: While thrombolysis is a reperfusion strategy for STEMI, it is generally reserved for situations where PCI is not readily available or feasible within recommended timeframes. PCI is preferred due to better outcomes and lower rates of re-infarction and bleeding.\nB. Percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting: This directly addresses the occluded artery by mechanically opening it and restoring blood flow, which is the primary goal in STEMI management. The presence of a thrombus amenable to intervention makes PCI a highly appropriate choice.\nC. Systemic anticoagulation with heparin: Anticoagulation is a critical component of STEMI management, preventing further thrombus formation and propagation. However, it is typically an adjunctive therapy to reperfusion (PCI or thrombolysis) and not the sole immediate management strategy when mechanical intervention is possible.\nD. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor infusion: These are potent antiplatelet agents that inhibit the final common pathway of platelet aggregation. They are often used adjunctively during PCI, especially in patients with high thrombus burden or during planned PCI. However, their role is usually adjunctive to reperfusion, not the primary immediate treatment on its own.\nE.

He is on anticoagulation, which poses a significant risk of bleeding if a thrombolytic agent is administered. The most critical factor in determining eligibility for intravenous thrombolysis in such a patient is the assessment of their current coagulability status, which directly relates to the bleeding risk.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. International normalized ratio (INR) value: For patients on warfarin, a common anticoagulant for atrial fibrillation, a high INR indicates excessive anticoagulation and is a contraindication for thrombolysis due to increased bleeding risk. This is a critical determinant of eligibility.\nB. Time since last anticoagulant dose: This is relevant, particularly for Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs), as it helps estimate the duration of anticoagulant effect. However, the INR (for warfarin) or specific assays (for DOACs) provide a more direct measure of coagulability. If the patient is on warfarin, time since last dose is less critical than the actual INR.\nC. Presence of atrial fibrillation: Atrial fibrillation is a common cause of ischemic stroke and is the reason for anticoagulation. Its presence is not a contraindication to thrombolysis.\nD. Stroke severity on NIHSS scale: While stroke severity influences treatment decisions and prognosis, absolute contraindications like significant coagulopathy or hemorrhage take precedence in determining initial eligibility.\nE. Reversal agent availability: The availability of reversal agents is important for managing potential complications, but it does not determine the initial eligibility for thrombolysis itself.\n\nGiven that the patient is on anticoagulation, the primary concern is the increased risk of hemorrhagic transformation of the infarct or systemic bleeding. Assessing the degree of anticoagulation is paramount. The INR is a standard laboratory test that measures the effect of warfarin. A significantly elevated INR is a well-established contraindication for IV thrombolysis. While other anticoagulants and their specific assays or time kinetics are also important, the INR is a direct and commonly used measure that represents a critical contraindication in many patients treated for atrial fibrillation.

Non-operative management is clearly inappropriate as the patient is already in the operating room for laparotomy due to instability.\n\nConsidering the patient's hemodynamic instability, total splenectomy is the most appropriate intraoperative management to rapidly control the source of bleeding.\n\nThe answer is (D)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251201T041413890Z_grok-4-0709_seed123", "question_id": "20251201T041413890Z_grok-4-0709_seed123-010", "question": "A 65-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis develops shortness of breath.

She has preserved left ventricular (LV) function. Coronary angiography is normal, ruling out ischemic MR.\n\nHere's an evaluation of the options:\nA.  Mitral valve repair: This is generally the preferred surgical option for degenerative mitral regurgitation, especially in patients with preserved LV function, as it often leads to better LV remodeling and functional outcomes compared to replacement. A flail leaflet is a common etiology of severe MR that can often be repaired surgically.\nB.  Mitral valve replacement with bioprosthesis: This is an alternative surgical option if repair is not feasible or fails. For a 65-year-old patient, a bioprosthesis is typically chosen to avoid long-term anticoagulation, assuming no other indications for it. However, repair is preferred when possible.\nC.  Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER): This percutaneous technique is primarily indicated for patients with severe symptomatic MR who are at high or prohibitive risk for conventional surgery. While the patient is 65, her surgical risk is not explicitly stated. However, the presence of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can sometimes be associated with increased perioperative risks or poorer outcomes with open-heart surgery due to systemic inflammation, tissue quality, or related comorbidities. This might place her at least in the intermediate-risk category, for which TEER is increasingly considered an option, especially for flail leaflets.\nD.  Medical management with afterload reduction: This is not sufficient for severe, symptomatic MR with a flail leaflet causing pulmonary hypertension. Medical management can provide symptomatic relief but does not address the underlying structural defect and can lead to progressive LV dysfunction and irreversible pulmonary hypertension.\nE.  Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT): CRT is indicated for heart failure patients with reduced LV ejection fraction and conduction abnormalities. This patient has preserved LV function and therefore CRT is not indicated.\n\nThe key consideration is the \"most appropriate intervention.\" For degenerative MR, surgical repair (A) is generally preferred. However, the mention of rheumatoid arthritis is significant, as RA can affect valve tissue and potentially increase surgical risk or reduce the durability of repairs. If the RA implies increased surgical risk or concerns about repair feasibility/durability, then TEER (C) becomes a strong contender. TEER has demonstrated effectiveness in treating flail mitral leaflets and is increasingly adopted for patients who are not ideal surgical candidates or are considered intermediate risk. Given that RA can complicate surgery, TEER is a plausible and increasingly used \"most appropriate\" option in such a profile, balancing efficacy with reduced invasiveness. Without explicit information about surgical risk assessment, and considering the potential impact of RA, TEER is a reasonable choice.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$."}]
