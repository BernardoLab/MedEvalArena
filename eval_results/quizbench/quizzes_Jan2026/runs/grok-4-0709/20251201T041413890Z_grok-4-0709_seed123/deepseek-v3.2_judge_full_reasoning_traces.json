The most appropriate next step per major guidelines (ACC/AHA, ESC) is septal reduction therapy (myectomy or ablation) for drug-refractory, severely symptomatic patients with significant obstruction. Mavacamten is a newer medical therapy, but its guideline position is typically for patients who are not candidates for or who wish to defer invasive therapy; it is not definitively established as the 'most appropriate next step' before considering proven invasive options. The keyed answer (E) is not the single best, guideline-supported choice. Main logical issue: A unique best answer exists (B or C), but the provided key is incorrect. Minimal fix: Change the key to B or C, or significantly alter the stem to specify the patient is not a candidate for invasive procedures.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n

Key stem clues: sudden thalamic hemorrhage in a 72-year-old with Parkinson's disease and orthostatic hypotension. The most likely mechanism for a deep, non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage in an elderly patient is hypertensive vasculopathy (option B), which is consistent with standard teaching. However, the vignette explicitly states the patient has a 'history of orthostatic hypotension,' which is a strong negative clue against chronic, poorly controlled hypertension as the primary etiology. This creates a contradiction: the keyed answer (B) requires an unstated assumption of chronic hypertension, while the stem provides a finding (orthostatic hypotension) often associated with normotension or well-controlled blood pressure. This internal inconsistency makes option B not uniquely defensible, and the item is miskeyed because the stem undermines its own correct answer. Minimal fix: Remove 'history of orthostatic hypotension' from the stem to eliminate the contradiction and support hypertensive vasculopathy as the clear best answer.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n    \"logical_validity\": false,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \"3\"\n}",

The clinical problem is confirming the cause of adrenal insufficiency in a patient with autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 2. Key stem clues are type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroiditis, vitiligo, low cortisol, and elevated ACTH, which strongly suggest autoimmune adrenalitis (Addison's disease). The best initial confirmatory test for adrenal insufficiency is the cosyntropin stimulation test (Option A), which is the standard first-line functional test. While 21-hydroxylase antibodies (Option C) are highly specific for autoimmune etiology, they are not the primary confirmatory test for the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency itself; they confirm the cause after insufficiency is established. The keyed answer (C) is not the most appropriate initial confirmatory test, making the item miskeyed. The main logical issue is miskeying; the main medical issue is prioritizing an etiological test over the standard functional diagnostic test.

The stem specifies the patient is on anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation but does not state the agent. The keyed answer (A, INR) is only the most critical factor if the anticoagulant is warfarin. For direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), time since last dose (B) is the critical factor, and INR is irrelevant. The stem is underspecified regarding the anticoagulant type, making the unique best answer dependent on an unstated assumption. This leads to a miskeying, as either A or B could be defended based on different assumptions. Main medical accuracy issue: The item's logic is only accurate for warfarin, not for all anticoagulation.

Key stem clues: acute worsening dyspnea, new ground-glass opacities on HRCT, neutrophilic BAL without infection—classic features of an acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (AE-IPF). Main logical issue: None. Main medical accuracy issue: The rationale correctly identifies high-dose corticosteroids as the standard initial therapy for AE-IPF, though evidence is limited. Antifibrotics (C, D) are for chronic disease modification, azathioprine (B) is contraindicated, and transplant evaluation (E) is not the immediate intervention. Minimal fix: None required; the item is logically valid and medically accurate for a board-style question.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"T\",\n    \"logical_validity\": true,\n

Key stem clues: hemodynamically unstable patient with splenic laceration found during exploratory laparotomy for trauma. The instability mandates definitive, rapid hemorrhage control. Main logical issue: None; the stem clearly indicates instability, which is the critical discriminator. Main medical accuracy issue: None; total splenectomy is the standard of care for unstable splenic trauma. Minimal fix: None required; the item is clear and accurate. Alternatives are correctly inferior: A and E are for stable patients; B and C are preservation techniques that are inappropriate in the setting of active, life-threatening hemorrhage.\",\n

Key stem clues: severe primary mitral regurgitation from a flail leaflet, preserved LV function, normal coronaries, and elevated pulmonary pressures. This defines a symptomatic patient with severe primary MR, a class I indication for surgical intervention. Mitral valve repair (A) is the gold standard for degenerative MR with flail leaflet, offering superior outcomes. Option B (replacement) is a second-line option if repair is not feasible. Option C (transcatheter repair) is typically for high-risk surgical patients, not specified here. Options D and E are incorrect as they do not correct the mechanical defect. The item is logically valid and medically accurate. Minimal fix: None required; the item is sound. A minor clarification could specify 'surgical candidate' in the stem to preempt debate about transcatheter eligibility, but it is not necessary.\",\n  \"logical_false_reason\": \"T\",\n  \"logical_validity\": true,\n  \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n  \"5\"\n}",
