Key stem clues: progressive dysphonia/stridor post-URI, bilateral vocal cord immobility, EMG showing denervation of posterior cricoarytenoid (abductor) with preserved thyroarytenoid (adductor). This selective denervation pattern is classic for bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, as the nerve supplies all intrinsic laryngeal muscles except the cricothyroid. The keyed answer (A) fits this pathophysiological mechanism. Alternatives are inferior: B (joint fixation) would not show this EMG pattern; C (paradoxical motion) is functional, not denervating; D (superior laryngeal nerve) spares abductors; E (scarring) would cause mechanical fixation, not selective denervation. No contradictions or missing details. Medical accuracy is sound.

Key stem clues: T6 spinal cord injury, recurrent UTIs, autonomic dysreflexia triggered by bladder distension, urodynamics showing detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia (DSD) with high post-void residuals. The clinical problem is identifying the best long-term management to prevent renal complications in neurogenic bladder with DSD and high pressures. The most appropriate initial long-term management, per guidelines, is clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) combined with anticholinergic medication (option A) to lower detrusor pressure. While augmentation cystoplasty (option D) is a valid surgical option for refractory cases, it is not the first-line, most appropriate long-term management from the stem as presented, which does not state failure of conservative therapy. The keyed answer (D) is a more invasive option typically reserved after failed conservative management, making option A the more defensible best answer. No major medical inaccuracies, but the logic of best-answer selection is flawed. Minimal fix: Change the key to A, or add to the stem 'after failure of initial pharmacologic and catheterization therapy' to justify D.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n

Key stem clues: Postoperative day 2 DIEP flap with signs of venous congestion (bluish discoloration, rapid capillary refill) and weak but present Doppler signals. This pattern strongly suggests a mechanical venous outflow issue at the anastomosis, making surgical exploration the definitive and immediate intervention. The rationale correctly distinguishes this from adjunctive measures like leech therapy (for mild, non-mechanical congestion) or anticoagulation (for thrombosis, not a primary mechanical obstruction). No internal contradictions or missing critical details are present. The item aligns with standard reconstructive microsurgery protocols. Minimal fix: None required; the item is clear and accurate as written.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"T\",\n    \"logical_validity\": true,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n    \t\n    \t\n

Key stem clues: severe venous air embolism with hemodynamic instability during posterior fossa craniotomy. The most effective immediate maneuver is direct removal of the embolus. Main logical issue: None; the stem clearly describes a severe, symptomatic embolism, making aspiration the definitive intervention. Main medical accuracy issue: None; aspiration via a central venous catheter is the standard immediate intervention for a large, symptomatic venous air embolism. Minimal fix: None required; the item is clear and accurate. Alternatives are inferior: flooding (A) is preventive, Trendelenburg (C) is often used but less definitive and potentially problematic in posterior fossa surgery, hyperventilation (D) is for intracranial pressure, and inotropes (E) are supportive but do not treat the embolism.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"T\",\n    \"logical_validity\": true,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n

Key stem clues: chronic diarrhea despite gluten-free diet, villous atrophy with intraepithelial lymphocytes on biopsy, negative anti-tTG serology. Main logical issue: The keyed answer (A, Refractory celiac disease type 1) is not the most likely diagnosis given the negative serology. In refractory celiac disease, serology (anti-tTG) is typically positive at diagnosis and may become negative with a strict diet, but the vignette does not specify prior serology status or duration of diet, making the presentation atypical for straightforward refractory disease. The findings are more characteristic of lymphocytic colitis (C), which involves intraepithelial lymphocytes and can occur with celiac disease, often presenting with chronic diarrhea and negative celiac serology. Main medical accuracy issue: The item implies refractory celiac disease is the most likely despite seronegativity, which is inconsistent with standard diagnostic criteria where serology is a key marker. Minimal fix: Change the key to C (Lymphocytic colitis) or revise the stem to include positive anti-tTG serology to support refractory celiac disease.\",\n  \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n  \"logical_validity\": false,\n  \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \"3\"\n}",

Key stem clues: hepatitis C cirrhosis, ascites with low SAAG/high protein (suggesting non-portal hypertensive ascites), renal insufficiency, biopsy showing membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). The most appropriate treatment for HCV-associated MPGN is direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy, which is option A and matches the key. However, the item is logically miskeyed because the keyed answer (A) is actually the correct best answer. The provided key is 'A', which is correct, so there is no miskeying. The logical failure is that the stem describes ascites with low SAAG/high protein, which is atypical for cirrhosis and suggests an alternative cause (e.g., peritoneal disease), creating a contradiction with the cirrhosis diagnosis and making the clinical picture incoherent. This contradiction (C) is the primary issue, leading to potential defensibility of other options like immunosuppressive therapy for MPGN if ascites is unrelated. Main medical accuracy issue: low SAAG ascites is not typical of uncomplicated cirrhosis, introducing pathophysiological inconsistency.
