The key to the diagnosis is the positive serum testing for anti-NMDA receptor antibodies. While anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis classically presents with psychiatric symptoms, seizures, and movement disorders, it can occasionally present with focal neurological deficits mimicking a stroke, or \"stroke-like\" episodes (sometimes overlapping with MELAS or lupus-associated stroke, but the specific antibody points to the encephalitis).\n\nCrucially, the presence of these antibodies suggests an autoimmune etiology rather than a primary thromboembolic event, especially given the lack of large vessel occlusion on angiography and the history of migraine (which can be a confounder or associated feature). The CSF findings are typically pleocytic in NMDAR encephalitis, but can be normal in early or atypical cases; the finding of 5 WBCs is borderline/normal but the antibody result is the diagnostic \"smoking gun\" in this exam vignette.\n\nManagement of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis involves immunotherapy. First-line treatment consists of high-dose corticosteroids (e.g., methylprednisolone), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), or plasmapheresis. Initial therapy is usually high-dose steroids followed by or combined with the others.\n\nA. Initiate intravenous thrombolysis: While the patient has stroke symptoms, the absence of LVO and the positive autoantibody result suggest an inflammatory mimic (autoimmune encephalitis). Thrombolysis is typically intended for ischemic stroke and carries hemorrhage risk if the lesion is inflammatory. In the context of the provided diagnostic test result, treating the underlying autoimmune cause is correct.\nB. Administer high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone: This is the standard first-line empiric and specific treatment for autoimmune encephalitis.\nC. Start rituximab infusion: Rituximab is valid second-line therapy for refractory cases, not the first step.\nD. Perform plasmapheresis: This is also a first-line option but is often logistically more complex than steroids and is typically used if steroids are ineffective or in conjunction; steroids are the most common \"appropriate next step\" answer.\nE.

The key diagnostic clue is the CSF analysis, which reveals a mild pleocytosis (10 WBCs/μL, mononuclear) and elevated protein.\n\n1.  CSF Findings: In uncomplicated Parkinson's disease, drug toxicity, or typical neurodegenerative progression (Lewy body dementia), the CSF white blood cell count should be normal (0-5 cells/μL). A count of 10 cells/μL indicates an inflammatory process (meningitis or encephalitis). The mononuclear predominance suggests a viral or autoimmune etiology rather than bacterial. HSV PCR is negative.\n2.  Clinical Picture: The combination of subacute psychiatric symptoms (hallucinations, paranoia) and neurological decline in an older adult, accompanied by inflammatory CSF, is highly suggestive of autoimmune encephalitis.\n3.  Anti-LGI1 Encephalitis: This is a form of limbic encephalitis that typically affects older adults (age ~60s). Symptoms include cognitive impairment, psychiatric disturbances (hallucinations, agitation), and seizures (specifically faciobrachial dystonic seizures, though not mentioned here, are pathognomonic). It can present with or mimic movement disorders. The mild inflammatory CSF changes fit this diagnosis.\n4.

Expectant management with bed rest: This is appropriate for *asymptomatic* and stable patients with PAS, with a goal of scheduled delivery around 34–36 weeks. However, this patient is symptomatic with severe pain and bleeding, making expectant management dangerous due to the risk of massive hemorrhage and maternal/fetal compromise.\n*   B. Immediate cesarean delivery: Given the acute symptoms of severe pain and bleeding, immediate delivery is indicated to safeguard the mother and fetus.

The CT finding of a complex adnexal mass with gas bubbles is the key discriminator.\n\n1.  Gas Bubbles: The presence of gas within a pelvic abscess usually indicates one of two things: infection with gas-forming organisms (such as *Clostridium* or certain anaerobes like *Bacteroides*) or a communication with a hollow viscus, specifically the bowel.\n2.  Surgical Context: Laparoscopic excision of endometriosis often involves extensive adhesiolysis, particularly in the cul-de-sac and near the rectosigmoid colon. Unrecognized bowel injury (micro-perforation or thermal injury) is a serious and known complication of this procedure.\n3.  Pathophysiology: A bowel perforation allows enteric contents, including bacteria and gas, to leak into the pelvic cavity, leading to the formation of a localized abscess (often involving the adnexa/ovary due to proximity). The \"vaginal cultures growing mixed anaerobes\" is consistent with localized pelvic infection, as anaerobes (like *Bacteroides*) are dominant in the colon and can also be found in the vagina; however, the gas is the hallmark of the bowel etiology.\n4.  Ruling out other options:\n    *   B. Endometrioma superinfection: This is more common after transvaginal aspiration (e.g., oocyte retrieval) where bacteria are introduced into the cyst. In excision surgery, the endometrioma is removed, making this less likely than an abscess formed from a complication. Furthermore, gas is strongly characteristic of bowel communication.\n    *   D.

The presence of syncope is a concerning symptom often related to the severe left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction (hemodynamic syncope) or arrhythmia.\n\nThe management of symptomatic obstructive HCM follows a stepwise approach:\n1.  First-line: Beta-blockers or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (like verapamil/diltiazem).\n2.  Second-line / Escalation: If symptoms persist (or gradients remain high), the traditional next step was often the addition of disopyramide or referral for Septal Reduction Therapy (SRT) (either surgical myectomy or alcohol septal ablation). However, the approval of cardiac myosin inhibitors, specifically Mavacamten, has changed the treatment landscape.\n\nMavacamten (Option E) is a small-molecule inhibitor of cardiac myosin that decreases actin-myosin cross-bridge formation, thereby reducing contractility and improving myocardial energetics. It targets the underlying pathophysiology of HCM (often associated with sarcomeric mutations like *MYH7* or *MYBPC3*). Clinical trials (e.g., EXPLORER-HCM, VALOR-HCM) have demonstrated that Mavacamten significantly reduces LVOT gradients and improves symptoms (NYHA class) in patients who are symptomatic despite standard therapy. Notably, the VALOR-HCM trial showed that Mavacamten treatment allowed a significant proportion of patients to avoid needing SRT (myectomy or ablation) for which they were previously eligible.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate *next* intervention before proceeding to invasive surgical procedures in a stable patient is the addition of Mavacamten.\n\n*   Surgical myectomy (B) and Alcohol septal ablation (A) are indicated for patients with severe drug-refractory symptoms (which this patient might be considered to have if Mavacamten were not available or failed). However, a trial of advanced medical therapy (Mavacamten) is now preferred prior to invasive intervention.\n*   ICD placement (C) is indicated for the prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD). While syncope is a risk factor, the decision for an ICD is based on a comprehensive risk stratification (looking at wall thickness, family history, NSVT, etc.). Even if an ICD were indicated for risk, it does not treat the obstructive symptoms (syncope caused by the 120 mmHg gradient). Management of the obstruction is the primary need presented.\n*   Dual-chamber pacing (D) is generally considered less effective than SRT or Mavacamten and is reserved for specific clinical scenarios (e.g., contraindication to other therapies).\n\nGiven the specific mention of the *MYH7* mutation (mechanistic target) and the availability of Mavacamten as a potent medical therapy for patients symptomatic on beta-blockers, it is the best next step.\n\nThe answer is (E)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251201T041413890Z_grok-4-0709_seed124", "question_id": "20251201T041413890Z_grok-4-0709_seed124-006", "question": "A 70-year-old woman with atrial fibrillation on apixaban develops acute chest pain.

Diagnosis: The patient has been diagnosed with Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD) of the LAD.\n2.  Clinical Status: She is hemodynamically stable, and the angiography reveals TIMI 3 flow (normal flow) in the affected vessel.\n3.  General Management Principle: The preferred management strategy for stable patients with SCAD who have preserved coronary blood flow and no ongoing ischemia is conservative management. Spontaneous healing of the vessel wall occurs in the vast majority of such cases.\n4.  Invasive Options: Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) (Option A) is associated with high complication rates in SCAD (e.g., guidewire entering the false lumen, propagation of the dissection or hematoma) and is generally reserved for patients with hemodynamic instability or total vessel occlusion/ongoing ischemia. Surgical bypass (Option D) is reserved for high-risk anatomy (like Left Main dissection) or failed PCI. Since this patient is stable with good flow, invasive measures are contraindicated.\n5.  Medical Therapy - Beta-blockers: Beta-blockers are the cornerstone of medical management in SCAD (Option E). They reduce heart rate and blood pressure, thereby decreasing arterial shear stress against the vessel wall, which promotes healing and reduces the risk of recurrence.\n6.  Medical Therapy - Anticoagulation: The patient is currently on apixaban for Atrial Fibrillation. In the setting of acute SCAD, systemic anticoagulation is generally discontinued because it can promote stricture of the true lumen by increasing the size of the intramural hematoma (bleeding into the vessel wall). Continuation of apixaban (Option B) is therefore ill-advised in the acute phase due to the risk of worsening the dissection. The risk of stroke from AF is weighed against the immediate risk of extension of the coronary dissection; usually, anticoagulation is held until the acute phase resolves.\n7.  Medical Therapy - Antiplatelets: While antiplatelet therapy (often aspirin or DAPT) is part of the regimen, Option C suggests switching to DAPT as the primary management answer. However, the most critical \"management decision\" in SCAD exams is distinguishing between Invasive vs. Conservative strategies. Furthermore, beta-blockers are the specific class linked to reduced recurrence.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate management is to avoid intervention and treat conservatively with medications that reduce wall stress (beta-blockers).\n\nThe answer is (E)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251201T041413890Z_grok-4-0709_seed124", "question_id": "20251201T041413890Z_grok-4-0709_seed124-007", "question": "A 40-year-old man returning from West Africa presents with fever, myalgias, and petechial rash.

Complication: The patient has developed acute kidney injury (AKI) with oliguria.\n3.  Treatment Options Analysis:\n    *   A. Intravenous ribavirin: While IV ribavirin is the classic antiviral therapy for Lassa fever (historically shown to reduce mortality if given within the first 6 days), it is significantly renally excreted. In patients with renal failure (implied by oliguric AKI), ribavirin accumulates, leading to severe, life-threatening hemolysis and mitochondrial toxicity. Consequently, significant renal impairment (Creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min) is a major contraindication for the standard use of ribavirin. Given the patient's oliguria and AKI, administering standard IV ribavirin would be hazardous.\n    *   B. Supportive care with hemodialysis: Supportive care is the cornerstone of management for viral hemorrhagic fevers. The patient has oliguric AKI, which is a lethal complication due to fluid overload, acidosis, and uremia. Renal replacement therapy (hemodialysis) is the definitive management for this specific life-threatening organ failure. In the presence of a contraindication to the primary antiviral (renal failure), aggressive supportive care, including dialysis, is the most appropriate and life-saving intervention.\n    *   C, D, E: Convalescent plasma is not the standard of care and lacks consistent efficacy data.

Address the Diagnostic Discrepancy: The scenario notes that serum beta-D-glucan (BDG) is negative. While BDG is a sensitive marker for PCP, false negatives can occur, particularly in HIV-negative immunocompromised patients (like transplant recipients) who often have a lower fungal burden than HIV-positive patients. The positive PCR and clinical/radiological findings confirm the infection, making the negative BDG a finding related to the specific patient population (low burden) rather than ruling out the disease.\n\n3.  Analyze the Problem: The patient developed this infection while on trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) prophylaxis. This is known as a \"breakthrough infection.\" The question asks for the explanation of this failure.\n\n4.  Evaluate Option A (Dihydropteroate synthase gene mutation): TMP-SMX works by inhibiting folate synthesis. Specifically, sulfamethoxazole inhibits the enzyme dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS). Resistance to sulfonamides in *P. jirovecii* is associated with specific point mutations in the DHPS gene.

Evaluate Other Options:\n    *   B. Non-adherence: While a common cause of failure in the real world, in the context of a board exam question providing a specific molecular mechanism of resistance (Option A), non-adherence is usually a diagnosis of exclusion or implied by social history. Option A is the specific pathological mechanism.\n    *   C. Concurrent CMV co-infection: CMV is a risk factor for PCP due to increased immunosuppression, but it does not mechanistically explain why the antibiotic prophylaxis failed to inhibit the organism if the organism were sensitive.\n    *   D.

In the context of secondary rheumatic MAS, it is generally reserved for life-threatening cases that are refractory to steroids and cytokine-targeted therapies.\n*   Intravenous immunoglobulin (E): May be used adjunctively but is not the primary initial treatment of choice for rheumatic MAS.\n\nTherefore, high-dose glucocorticoids are the most appropriate initial step.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251201T041413890Z_grok-4-0709_seed124", "question_id": "20251201T041413890Z_grok-4-0709_seed124-010", "question": "A 65-year-old man with giant cell arteritis on prednisone taper develops jaw claudication and vision loss.

High-dose prednisone is initial but inadequate for escalation in biopsy-negative cases. Methotrexate is steroid-sparing but less effective for vision-threatening disease.", "generator_model": "grok-4-0709", "seed": 124, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "pred": "C", "model_outputs": "This patient has Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) characterized by a relapse during a prednisone taper, evidenced by clinical symptoms (jaw claudication, vision loss), elevated inflammatory markers (ESR 80 mm/hr), and large vessel involvement (aortic arch on CTA).\n\nThe key management points are:\n1.  Diagnosis: The patient has a relapse of GCA. The negative temporal artery biopsy is consistent with GCA that primarily affects large vessels (LV-GCA) or skip lesions, but the CTA findings and clinical presentation confirm the diagnosis.\n2.  Current Status: He has failed the initial treatment strategy (prednisone taper) and developed severe ischemic complications (vision loss).\n3.  Treatment of Relapse: According to the 2021 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and EULAR guidelines:\n    *   For patients with GCA who experience a relapse, adding a non-glucocorticoid immunosuppressive agent is recommended.\n    *   Tocilizumab (an IL-6 receptor antagonist) is the preferred agent over methotrexate. The GiACTA trial demonstrated the efficacy of tocilizumab in achieving sustained corticosteroid-free remission in patients with GCA, particularly those with relapsing disease.\n4.  Ischemic Complications: While the immediate management of GCA with visual loss typically involves high-dose intravenous (pulse) methylprednisolone, this option is not listed. Option A suggests increasing oral prednisone to 60 mg. While increasing steroids is necessary to control active inflammation, reverting to oral prednisone alone in a patient who has already relapsed (and has severe large vessel involvement) is often insufficient to maintain long-term remission and minimize cumulative steroid toxicity. Therefore, the addition of a biologic agent is the critical *escalation* in therapy.\n5.  Large Vessel Involvement: Patients with extracranial large vessel involvement (LV-GCA) often require more aggressive therapy and benefit significantly from the addition of tocilizumab.\n\nBased on the guidelines for relapsing GCA and the presence of severe disease features requiring steroid-sparing escalation, initiating tocilizumab is the most appropriate step among the choices provided (typically in conjunction with determining the appropriate steroid regimen, but C represents the escalation).\n\nOption A is a temporary measure that does not address the refractory nature of the disease.\nOption B is a less effective alternative to tocilizumab.\nOption D is typically reserved for other types of vasculitis (e.g., ANCA-associated) or life-threatening situations not responsive to standard GCA therapies, but tocilizumab is the FDA-approved standard for this scenario.\nOption E is diagnostic and unnecessary given the CTA findings.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}]
