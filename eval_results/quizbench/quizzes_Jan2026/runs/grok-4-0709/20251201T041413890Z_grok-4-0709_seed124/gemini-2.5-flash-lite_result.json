However, the crucial finding is the positive serum anti-NMDA receptor antibodies. This strongly indicates anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis as the underlying diagnosis. Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is an autoimmune disorder that can cause a wide spectrum of neurological symptoms, including psychosis, seizures, movement disorders, and focal neurological deficits that can mimic stroke. The mild lymphocytic pleocytosis on lumbar puncture is also consistent with an inflammatory or autoimmune process.\n\nLet's evaluate the options in light of this diagnosis:\n\nA. Initiate intravenous thrombolysis: Thrombolysis is indicated for acute ischemic stroke. However, while the MRI shows stroke-like changes, the identified autoimmune etiology suggests the neurological deficits might be secondary to the encephalitis rather than a primary cerebrovascular event requiring thrombolysis, especially if there's no large vessel occlusion. Aggressive immunosuppression is the priority here.\n\nB. Administer high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone: High-dose corticosteroids are a cornerstone of first-line treatment for anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. They aim to reduce inflammation and suppress the autoimmune attack on NMDA receptors. This is a highly appropriate next step.\n\nC. Start rituximab infusion: Rituximab is a B-cell depleting agent and is often used as a second-line treatment for anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis if patients do not respond to initial therapies such as steroids or IVIg. It is not typically the *first* treatment initiated.\n\nD. Perform plasmapheresis: Plasmapheresis (plasma exchange) is also considered a first-line therapy for anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, often used alongside or as an alternative to high-dose steroids or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). However, empirical administration of high-dose steroids is a common and rapid initial intervention while further therapeutic strategies are planned. Given the options, both B and D are strong contenders for first-line therapy. Without specific details about disease severity or local protocols, high-dose steroids are a very common and often immediate first step.\n\nE. Administer acyclovir empirically: Acyclovir is used to treat viral infections, most commonly herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis. While HSV encephalitis can cause focal neurological deficits, the positive anti-NMDA receptor antibodies overwhelmingly point towards an autoimmune etiology, making empirical antiviral treatment inappropriate and unnecessary.\n\nConsidering the options, addressing the underlying autoimmune process is paramount. High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone is a standard and crucial first-line treatment for anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. While plasmapheresis is also first-line, initiating high-dose steroids is a very common and immediate therapeutic step.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."}, {"quiz_id": "20251201T041413890Z_grok-4-0709_seed124", "question_id": "20251201T041413890Z_grok-4-0709_seed124-002", "question": "A 62-year-old woman with Parkinson's disease on levodopa/carbidopa develops sudden visual hallucinations and paranoia.

These symptoms are well-known psychiatric side effects of dopaminergic medications. The mesolimbic pathway, a dopaminergic pathway, is implicated in psychosis. Overstimulation of this pathway by levodopa/carbidopa can lead to hallucinations and paranoia. The sudden onset strongly suggests an iatrogenic cause, i.e., a side effect of the medication. The worsening of the UPDRS score by 15 points could reflect the impact of these new non-motor symptoms, which are part of the overall disease burden and treatment response.\n\nLet's consider the other options:\nB. Alpha-synuclein aggregation in occipital lobes: While Lewy body pathology can cause visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease, it typically causes them over time, and a sudden onset is less characteristic of progression of the underlying pathology itself.\nC. Autoimmune encephalitis with anti-LGI1 antibodies: This condition can cause neuropsychiatric symptoms, and the CSF findings (mild pleocytosis, elevated protein) are somewhat consistent. However, anti-LGI1 encephalitis often presents with limbic symptoms like seizures and memory loss, and this is less likely than a medication side effect given the patient's history and current treatment.\nD. Lewy body deposition in limbic structures: This is the pathological basis for many non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease, including psychosis, but the *sudden onset* points more to an acute trigger, like medication, rather than rapid progression of Lewy body accumulation.\nE. Serotonergic imbalance from medication withdrawal: There is no mention of medication withdrawal, and levodopa/carbidopa is not typically associated with precipitating sudden psychosis upon withdrawal. Withdrawal of dopaminergic agents may lead to motor deterioration and depression.\n\nThus, dopaminergic overstimulation is the most likely explanation for the patient's sudden onset of visual hallucinations and paranoia.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251201T041413890Z_grok-4-0709_seed124", "question_id": "20251201T041413890Z_grok-4-0709_seed124-003", "question": "A 28-year-old woman at 32 weeks gestation presents with severe pelvic pain and vaginal bleeding.

PAS is characterized by abnormal placental adherence to the uterine wall, which can lead to catastrophic hemorrhage during attempted separation, particularly at the time of delivery.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\nA. Expectant management with bed rest: This is not appropriate for a symptomatic patient with suspected PAS at 32 weeks gestation. The risks of severe bleeding, uterine rupture, and hysterectomy increase with gestational age and symptoms. Expectant management is generally reserved for asymptomatic, incidentally diagnosed PAS managed conservatively before term, with a high index of suspicion and careful monitoring.\n\nB. Immediate cesarean delivery: This is the most appropriate management for symptomatic PAS at a gestational age that allows for fetal viability or near viability (32 weeks is well within this range). Given the severity of symptoms and the high risk of uncontrolled bleeding with continued pregnancy or spontaneous labor, a planned, rapid delivery via cesarean section is indicated. This is often performed as a cesarean hysterectomy to manage the abnormal placental invasion and prevent hemorrhage, though uterine preservation might be attempted in select cases. The goal is to deliver the fetus and control the bleeding before it becomes life-threatening.\n\nC. Uterine artery embolization: This procedure is typically used to manage postpartum hemorrhage or to reduce blood supply in conditions like uterine fibroids. It is not a primary treatment for PAS in utero.\n\nD. Balloon tamponade post-delivery: This is a technique to control massive postpartum bleeding, often after delivery or hysterectomy. It is a management strategy for hemorrhage, not for the management of the pregnancy itself with suspected PAS.\n\nE. Prophylactic internal iliac artery ligation: This is a surgical intervention to reduce pelvic blood flow and is sometimes performed prophylactically or surgically during cesarean hysterectomy for PAS to help control severe bleeding. However, it is an adjunct to delivery and/or hysterectomy, not the primary management strategy for the pregnancy.\n\nConsidering the patient is symptomatic, at 32 weeks gestation, and has strong evidence of PAS, immediate intervention to deliver the baby and manage the placenta is crucial to prevent life-threatening hemorrhage.

A CT scan revealed a 5 cm complex adnexal mass with gas bubbles. Blood cultures were negative, but vaginal cultures grew mixed anaerobes.\n\nLet's analyze the key findings and options:\n*   Postoperative symptoms (fever, leukocytosis, pelvic pain): Suggestive of an infectious or inflammatory process.\n*   CT findings (5 cm complex adnexal mass with gas bubbles): The presence of gas bubbles is a critical clue, strongly indicating infection by gas-forming organisms, most commonly anaerobes. An adnexal mass indicates a localized collection of fluid, pus, or degenerated tissue in the region of the ovary or fallopian tube.\n*   Vaginal cultures (mixed anaerobes): Supports the involvement of anaerobic bacteria in the pelvic region.\n*   History of endometriosis and laparoscopic surgery: Endometriosis can involve the bowel, and laparoscopic surgery, especially for deep infiltrating endometriosis, carries a risk of iatrogenic bowel injury.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA.  Ovarian abscess from bowel perforation: Endometriosis implants can adhere to the sigmoid colon or rectum. Laparoscopic surgery can inadvertently injure the bowel. Bowel perforation releases gut flora, which are rich in gas-forming anaerobes, leading to abscess formation. Gas bubbles on CT are highly characteristic of such an anaerobic infection originating from the gut. An abscess can form within or adjacent to the adnexa. This option fits all findings well.\n\nB.  Endometrioma superinfection: While an endometrioma can become infected, endometriomas themselves are typically filled with old blood and do not inherently contain gas. Gas within a superinfected endometrioma would likely require specific gas-forming organisms and a favorable environment, or communication with another gas-containing structure. This is less likely than a primary source of anaerobes like the bowel.\n\nC.  Tubo-ovarian abscess from pelvic inflammatory disease (PID): PID can lead to tubo-ovarian abscesses. Endometriosis is a risk factor for PID. However, gas bubbles within a TOA are not typical unless there's a secondary complication like a fistula to the bowel.\n\nD.  Postoperative hematoma with secondary infection: A hematoma can become infected, but hematomas do not contain gas. For gas to be present, gas-forming organisms would need to infect the hematoma. While possible, it's less directly explained by the common complications of laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis compared to bowel injury.\n\nE.  Clostridial myonecrosis of the uterus: Clostridial myonecrosis is a severe necrotizing infection causing gas gangrene. While *Clostridium* is an anaerobe and produces gas, this condition typically involves significant necrosis of uterine muscle and can be systemic, often postpartum or after certain uterine procedures. The CT finding is described as an *adnexal* mass with gas, making a primary Clostridial myonecrosis of the uterus less likely as the sole explanation for a localized adnexal process.\n\nConsidering the presence of gas bubbles on CT as the most distinguishing feature, an origin from the gastrointestinal tract due to inadvertent perforation during surgery is the most likely explanation for the anaerobic infection and subsequent abscess.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$."}, {"quiz_id": "20251201T041413890Z_grok-4-0709_seed124", "question_id": "20251201T041413890Z_grok-4-0709_seed124-005", "question": "A 58-year-old man with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy presents with syncope.

It is an option for symptomatic obstructive HCM refractory to medical therapy.\nB. Surgical myectomy: This is considered the gold standard for relieving LVOT obstruction in symptomatic obstructive HCM refractory to medical therapy. It is a more invasive procedure than alcohol septal ablation.\nC. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement: ICDs are indicated for patients at high risk of sudden cardiac death due to arrhythmias. While HCM carries an increased risk of SCD, the primary problem described is symptomatic LVOT obstruction, not necessarily documented ventricular arrhythmias causing the syncope.\nD. Dual-chamber pacing: This can sometimes reduce LVOT gradients, but its efficacy is variable and it's generally considered a less definitive option compared to myectomy or ablation.\nE. Mavacamten therapy: Mavacamten is a novel, first-in-class cardiac myosin inhibitor that directly targets the hypercontractility underlying HCM and reduces LVOT obstruction. It is indicated for symptomatic NYHA class II-III obstructive HCM to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular death and all-cause hospitalizations for heart failure. It is approved for patients who remain symptomatic despite medical therapy.\n\nGiven that the patient is symptomatic despite beta-blockers and has significant LVOT obstruction, mavacamten therapy represents a targeted, less invasive pharmacologic intervention that directly addresses the underlying pathophysiology of his obstructive symptoms.

She is 70 years old, has atrial fibrillation (AF), and is currently on apixaban for AF. She is hemodynamically stable with TIMI 3 flow, indicating that the dissection is not causing severe flow limitation or hemodynamic compromise.\n\nLet's analyze the management options:\n\nA.  Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting: SCAD management guidelines generally favor a conservative approach for stable SCAD without high-risk features. PCI is typically reserved for cases with hemodynamic instability, persistent ischemia, significant left main involvement, or failure of conservative management. Since this patient is hemodynamically stable with TIMI 3 flow, PCI is not the most appropriate initial management.\n\nB.  Continuation of apixaban with close monitoring: Apixaban is a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) used to prevent stroke in patients with AF. Given the patient's AF, continuing apixaban is crucial for stroke prevention. SCAD management typically involves antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and often a P2Y12 inhibitor), but the decision on combined antithrombotic therapy in patients with both SCAD and AF (requiring anticoagulation) is complex due to increased bleeding risk. For patients with AF requiring anticoagulation, continuing the DOAC is generally recommended, alongside antiplatelet therapy for SCAD. \"Close monitoring\" aligns with a conservative approach to the SCAD, observing its progression and the patient's symptoms. This option prioritizes maintaining essential treatment for AF while adopting a watchful approach for the SCAD.\n\nC.  Switch to dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT): Switching to DAPT implies discontinuing apixaban. This would place the patient at a significantly higher risk of stroke due to her atrial fibrillation, which is unacceptable in a 70-year-old patient. While DAPT might be used for SCAD, it's usually in addition to anticoagulation for AF, or if AF is managed differently. Switching *from* apixaban to DAPT without addressing AF anticoagulation is not appropriate.\n\nD.  Surgical bypass grafting: Surgical revascularization is generally reserved for SCAD involving the left main coronary artery, ostial lesions, severe multi-vessel disease, or when conservative/interventional management fails. For stable LAD SCAD, surgery is not the first-line option.\n\nE.  Conservative management with beta-blockers: Conservative management is indeed the preferred approach for stable SCAD. This typically includes beta-blockers, statins, blood pressure control, and antiplatelet therapy (usually aspirin). While beta-blockers are an important part of SCAD management, this option is incomplete as it does not explicitly mention the crucial role of antiplatelet therapy for the SCAD itself, nor does it address the continuity of apixaban for AF.\n\nConsidering the patient's conditions, the most appropriate strategy is to maintain her anticoagulation for AF while managing the SCAD conservatively. Option B directly addresses the continuation of her established treatment for AF (apixaban), which is life-saving. The \"close monitoring\" implies that SCAD management will proceed conservatively, likely involving aspirin and beta-blockers, without immediate invasive intervention. This approach balances the need to prevent AF-related stroke with the conservative management of SCAD.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."}, {"quiz_id": "20251201T041413890Z_grok-4-0709_seed124", "question_id": "20251201T041413890Z_grok-4-0709_seed124-007", "question": "A 40-year-old man returning from West Africa presents with fever, myalgias, and petechial rash.

Dihydropteroate synthase gene mutation: TMP-SMX targets the dihydropteroate synthase enzyme in the folic acid synthesis pathway of *P. jirovecii*. Point mutations in the gene encoding this enzyme can confer resistance to TMP-SMX. This is a well-documented mechanism of drug resistance that would directly explain why the prophylaxis is ineffective, even if the patient is adherent and adequately dosed for their weight.\n\nB.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG): IVIG can have immunomodulatory effects but is not a primary treatment for HLH itself.\n\nGiven the severity of the patient's presentation (pancytopenia, hemophagocytosis), etoposide is considered essential for rapidly suppressing the hyperactive immune response responsible for the hemophagocytosis and multi-organ/cytokine storm. While high-dose glucocorticoids are also crucial, etoposide is often the agent that leads to rapid control of the cellular destruction when the disease is severe. Without the option that combines both (which would be ideal), etoposide-based chemotherapy represents the most definitive and potent initial intervention for severe HLH among the choices provided.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$."}, {"quiz_id": "20251201T041413890Z_grok-4-0709_seed124", "question_id": "20251201T041413890Z_grok-4-0709_seed124-010", "question": "A 65-year-old man with giant cell arteritis on prednisone taper develops jaw claudication and vision loss.

Methotrexate is steroid-sparing but less effective for vision-threatening disease.", "generator_model": "grok-4-0709", "seed": 124, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "pred": "C", "model_outputs": "The patient presents with symptoms highly suggestive of active giant cell arteritis (GCA): jaw claudication and vision loss. While on a prednisone taper, the development of new, severe symptoms, especially vision loss, indicates an inadequate current treatment regimen or active disease. The elevated ESR supports active inflammation. A negative temporal artery biopsy does not rule out GCA, particularly when clinical suspicion is high and large vessel involvement (aortic arch on CTA) is present.\n\nVision loss in GCA is a medical emergency requiring prompt and aggressive treatment to preserve vision and prevent irreversible damage.\n\n*   A. Increase prednisone to 60 mg daily: This is a standard approach for active and severe GCA, especially with visual symptoms. Patients with GCA visual symptoms are often started on high-dose prednisone (e.g., 1 mg/kg/day, often 40-60 mg or higher) or pulsed methylprednisolone. Since the patient is on a taper and experiencing new severe symptoms, returning to or increasing prednisone to a higher dose is a necessary step.\n*   B. Add methotrexate: Methotrexate is often used as a steroid-sparing agent to reduce cumulative steroid dose and prevent relapses. However, it is typically introduced after initial control is achieved with high-dose glucocorticoids, or in patients failing to taper steroids or experiencing frequent flares, rather than as the primary escalation for acute, sight-threatening disease.\n*   C. Initiate tocilizumab: Tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor inhibitor, has demonstrated significant efficacy in managing GCA, particularly in large-vessel GCA and in reducing relapses. Current guidelines recommend its use in combination with glucocorticoids, especially for patients with large-vessel GCA or those at high risk of relapse or steroid-related side effects. Given the patient's vision loss (a severe complication) and aortic arch involvement (large-vessel GCA), initiating tocilizumab alongside an appropriate glucocorticoid regimen represents a highly appropriate and potent escalation in therapy to achieve rapid disease control and prevent further damage.\n*   D. Start cyclophosphamide: Cyclophosphamide is a potent immunosuppressant but is generally not the first choice for GCA due to its toxicity and the availability of more targeted therapies.\n*   E. Perform temporal artery ultrasound: The diagnosis of GCA is strongly suspected clinically, and the patient is already on treatment. While ultrasound can aid in diagnosis, it is not an escalation of therapy. The management focus is on controlling active, severe disease.\n\nConsidering the severe complication of vision loss and the presence of large vessel involvement, initiating tocilizumab is considered a key escalation strategy in modern GCA management to achieve rapid and sustained remission, and to mitigate the risks associated with chronic high-dose glucocorticoid therapy. While increasing prednisone is also important, tocilizumab offers a more targeted and advanced approach for this critical scenario.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$."}]
