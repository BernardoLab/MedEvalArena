The imaging confirms an acute ischemic stroke in the left MCA territory without large vessel occlusion, suggesting a small vessel or embolic etiology.\n\n2. Anti-NMDA receptor antibodies are positive. While anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis typically presents with psychiatric symptoms, seizures, movement disorders, and autonomic instability, the presence of these antibodies in a stroke patient raises concern for an autoimmune/inflammatory etiology.\n\n3. However, the CSF is essentially normal (minimal pleocytosis, normal protein), which is atypical for active anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.\n\n4. The clinical picture with stroke and positive anti-NMDA antibodies could suggest an autoimmune vasculitis or inflammatory process affecting cerebral vessels.\n\n5. For acute ischemic stroke with autoimmune/inflammatory etiology:\n- IV thrombolysis (A) - would only be appropriate within the time window and if no contraindications; the question doesn't specify timing\n- High-dose IV methylprednisolone (B) - first-line treatment for autoimmune/inflammatory CNS conditions\n- Rituximab (C) - second-line therapy, not first step\n- Plasmapheresis (D) - can be used but typically after or alongside steroids\n- Acyclovir (E) - for HSV encephalitis, not indicated here\n\nGiven the positive anti-NMDA receptor antibodies suggesting an autoimmune etiology for the stroke, and the need for immunomodulatory therapy, high-dose IV methylprednisolone would be the most appropriate first-line treatment.

Visual hallucinations and paranoia are classic dopaminergic side effects. However, this typically wouldn't cause worsening motor symptoms (UPDRS worsening) or CSF changes.\n\nOption B - Alpha-synuclein aggregation in occipital lobes:\nThis could explain visual hallucinations but wouldn't typically present suddenly and wouldn't explain the CSF findings.\n\nOption C - Autoimmune encephalitis with anti-LGI1 antibodies:\nAnti-LGI1 encephalitis typically presents with faciobrachial dystonic seizures, hyponatremia, and cognitive changes. The CSF findings here are mild and could be consistent, but this is less common in PD patients.\n\nOption D - Lewy body deposition in limbic structures:\nThis represents progression of Parkinson's disease dementia or dementia with Lewy bodies. Lewy body spread to limbic structures (amygdala, hippocampus) causes visual hallucinations, paranoia, and cognitive decline. The worsening UPDRS score suggests disease progression. The mild CSF pleocytosis and elevated protein could reflect neurodegeneration with mild inflammatory response. This would explain both the psychiatric symptoms AND the motor worsening as part of disease progression.\n\nOption E - Serotonergic imbalance from medication withdrawal:\nThere's no indication of medication withdrawal, and levodopa/carbidopa primarily affects dopamine, not serotonin.\n\nThe combination of visual hallucinations, paranoia, AND worsening motor symptoms (UPDRS) in a Parkinson's patient suggests disease progression with Lewy body spread to limbic structures, which is characteristic of Parkinson's disease dementia.

Ovarian abscess from bowel perforation: While bowel perforation can occur during laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis (especially with bowel involvement), this would typically present with peritonitis, and the gas would be more diffuse. Blood cultures would more likely be positive with bowel perforation.\n\nB. Endometrioma superinfection: This is a strong possibility. The patient has known endometriosis, and endometriomas can become infected after surgical manipulation. The complex adnexal mass with gas bubbles and mixed anaerobes from vaginal cultures supports this. Superinfection of an endometrioma during surgery is a recognized complication.\n\nC. Tubo-ovarian abscess from PID: TOA typically occurs from ascending infection in sexually active women, usually associated with STIs (gonorrhea, chlamydia). There's no history suggesting PID, and the timing (postoperative) makes this less likely. The cultures show mixed anaerobes, not typical PID pathogens.\n\nD. Postoperative hematoma with secondary infection: While hematomas can become infected, the presence of gas bubbles and the complex adnexal mass location is more consistent with an infected pre-existing structure (endometrioma).\n\nE. Clostridial myonecrosis of the uterus: This is a severe, rapidly progressive infection that would present with more systemic toxicity, and blood cultures would likely be positive. This is rare and doesn't fit the presentation.\n\nBest answer: The scenario describes a postoperative infection in a patient with endometriosis. The complex adnexal mass with gas bubbles, mixed anaerobes, and the surgical context strongly suggests superinfection of an endometrioma. Endometriomas can become colonized with vaginal flora during surgery, leading to abscess formation.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251201T041413890Z_grok-4-0709_seed124", "question_id": "20251201T041413890Z_grok-4-0709_seed124-005", "question": "A 58-year-old man with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy presents with syncope.

Syncope in HCM is a red flag for sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk. This needs to be addressed.\n\n2. Severe LVOT obstruction (gradient >50 mmHg is considered significant; this patient has 80-120 mmHg) causing symptoms despite medical therapy requires intervention.\n\n3. Treatment options for refractory obstructive HCM:\n   - Surgical myectomy (B): Gold standard for septal reduction therapy, especially in younger patients and those with other cardiac pathology\n   - Alcohol septal ablation (A): Alternative for those not surgical candidates\n   - Mavacamten (E): Newer cardiac myosin inhibitor, approved for symptomatic obstructive HCM\n   - Dual-chamber pacing (D): Limited role, not first-line\n   - ICD (C): For SCD prevention, not for obstruction relief\n\n4. Syncope consideration: While syncope is a risk factor for SCD and ICD might be considered, the immediate issue is the severe symptomatic obstruction. However, syncope in HCM with severe obstruction could be due to the obstruction itself (hemodynamic) rather than arrhythmia.\n\n5. Guidelines: For patients with obstructive HCM who remain symptomatic despite optimal medical therapy (including beta-blockers), septal reduction therapy is indicated. Surgical myectomy is preferred over alcohol ablation when performed at experienced centers, particularly for younger patients.\n\n6. Mavacamten: While this is a newer option, for a patient with syncope and such severe gradients who has failed beta-blockers, more definitive intervention (surgical myectomy) would typically be recommended.\n\nGiven the severe obstruction, syncope (suggesting hemodynamic compromise), and failure of medical therapy, surgical myectomy is the most appropriate definitive intervention.
