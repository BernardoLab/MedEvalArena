Laboratory findings include elevated ferritin, pancytopenia, and hypertriglyceridemia. What is the most appropriate next step in management?", "options": ["Discontinue etanercept and initiate high-dose corticosteroids", "Administer intravenous immunoglobulin", "Start rituximab infusion", "Perform bone marrow biopsy immediately", "Initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics"], "answer": "A", "answer_index": 0, "explanation": "This presentation is consistent with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), a life-threatening complication in rheumatic diseases like juvenile idiopathic arthritis, often triggered by biologic agents such as etanercept. Discontinuing the offending agent and starting high-dose corticosteroids is the initial management to control the cytokine storm. Bone marrow biopsy may confirm hemophagocytosis but is not the immediate next step, and antibiotics are inappropriate without evidence of infection.", "generator_model": "grok-4-0709", "seed": 126, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "pred": "A", "model_outputs": "The answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251201T041413890Z_grok-4-0709_seed126", "question_id": "20251201T041413890Z_grok-4-0709_seed126-002", "question": "A 65-year-old man with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy develops sudden syncope during exercise. Echocardiography shows left ventricular outflow tract obstruction with a gradient of 80 mmHg. Despite beta-blocker therapy, symptoms persist. What is the most definitive management option?", "options": ["Surgical septal myectomy", "Alcohol septal ablation", "Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement", "Dual-chamber pacing", "Verapamil initiation"], "answer": "A", "answer_index": 0, "explanation": "Surgical septal myectomy is the gold standard for symptomatic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with severe outflow tract obstruction refractory to medical therapy, offering superior long-term outcomes in experienced centers. Alcohol septal ablation is an alternative but carries risks like heart block and is less effective in younger patients. ICD placement addresses arrhythmic risk but not the obstruction itself.", "generator_model": "grok-4-0709", "seed": 126, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "pred": "A", "model_outputs": "The answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251201T041413890Z_grok-4-0709_seed126", "question_id": "20251201T041413890Z_grok-4-0709_seed126-003", "question": "A term neonate develops respiratory distress and hypotension shortly after birth.

This is distinct from viral myocarditis, which typically presents later and lacks the maternal autoimmune history. Metabolic or genetic causes are less likely without additional syndromic features.", "generator_model": "grok-4-0709", "seed": 126, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "pred": "A", "model_outputs": "The answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251201T041413890Z_grok-4-0709_seed126", "question_id": "20251201T041413890Z_grok-4-0709_seed126-004", "question": "A 28-year-old woman at 32 weeks gestation presents with severe preeclampsia and acute dyspnea.

Despite fluid resuscitation, oliguria persists. Continuous renal replacement therapy is initiated. What is the most appropriate modality to optimize hemodynamic stability?", "options": ["Continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration with citrate anticoagulation", "Intermittent hemodialysis with bicarbonate buffer", "Sustained low-efficiency dialysis", "Peritoneal dialysis", "Continuous venovenous hemofiltration alone"], "answer": "A", "answer_index": 0, "explanation": "Continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) provides both convective and diffusive clearance, making it ideal for septic shock with acidosis, and citrate anticoagulation minimizes clotting while providing regional effects.
