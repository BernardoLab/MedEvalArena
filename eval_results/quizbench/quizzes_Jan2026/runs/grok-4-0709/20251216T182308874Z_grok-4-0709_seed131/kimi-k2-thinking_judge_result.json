Verdict: Keyed answer D is not the best; B and C are equally defensible. Key stem clues: CKD stage 4, hyperkalemia refractory to diet and loop diuretics, normal acid-base, no ACEi. The question asks for most appropriate pharmacologic intervention. In CKD stage 4, first-line chronic therapy for hyperkalemia is a potassium binder. Patiromer (B) and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (C) are both approved and effective in advanced CKD without dialysis; they are preferred over sodium polystyrene sulfonate (A) due to safety, and over fludrocortisone (D) which is not indicated in the absence of hypoaldosteronism and risks volume overload. Sodium bicarbonate (E) is for metabolic acidosis. Because B and C are both appropriate and the stem provides no basis to prefer one, the item allows multiple best answers. The keyed answer D is inconsistent with current guidelines and misstates the efficacy of newer binders. Minimal fix: Replace D with \"Initiate patiromer therapy\" and revise the rationale to reflect that patiromer (or SZC) is the preferred binder in advanced CKD; alternatively, specify a distinguishing factor (e.g., need for rapid onset) to select SZC over patiromer.", "medical_accuracy_score": 1, "logical_validity": false, "logical_false_reason": "M", "verdict": "FAIL", "fail_reason": "M"}, "judge_verdict": "FAIL", "judge_fail_reason": "M", "judge_medical_accuracy_score": 1}, {"quiz_id": "20251216T182308874Z_grok-4-0709_seed131", "question_id": "20251216T182308874Z_grok-4-0709_seed131-009", "question": "A 40-year-old woman with sickle cell disease presents with acute chest syndrome.
