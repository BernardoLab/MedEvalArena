Adagrasib monotherapy (B) will likely be undermined by the MET-driven bypass track. Docetaxel/ramucirumab (A) is standard chemo after immunotherapy but ignores a newly actionable resistance pathway in a trial-eligible patient. Pembrolizumab dose escalation (D) and re-induction platinum doublet with bevacizumab (E) are unlikely to benefit after clear progression on prior chemoimmunotherapy.", "generator_model": "gpt-5.1-2025-11-13", "seed": 131, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "target_topic": "Medical Oncology", "abms_specialty": "Medical Oncology", "abms_source": "target_topic", "source_label_raw": "Medical Oncology", "source_quiz_id": "20251223T225810101Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed131", "source_question_id": "20251223T225810101Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed131-001", "source_runs_root": "/home/dbernardo/Documents/pyres/MedEvalArena/eval_results/quizbench/quizzes_Jan2026/runs", "source_run_dir": "/home/dbernardo/Documents/pyres/MedEvalArena/eval_results/quizbench/quizzes_Jan2026/runs/gpt-5.1-2025-11-13/20251223T225810101Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed131", "source_quiz_path": "/home/dbernardo/Documents/pyres/MedEvalArena/quizzes/quizzes_Jan2026/20251223T225810101Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed131.jsonl", "pred": "C", "model_outputs": "The answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p03", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p03-010", "question": "A 37-year-old woman develops generalized urticaria, throat tightness, and hypotension within 10 minutes of receiving a first infusion of rituximab for relapsed follicular lymphoma. Symptoms resolve completely with epinephrine, antihistamines, and steroids; tryptase 90 minutes after onset is elevated. Skin testing later shows strong positive intradermal response to rituximab at non-irritating concentrations. She requires anti-CD20 therapy for disease control and has failed obinutuzumab. Which is the most appropriate management of her need for B-cell-depleting therapy?\n\nA. Avoid all monoclonal antibodies and use lenalidomide alone\nB. Perform rapid drug desensitization to rituximab under intensive monitoring\nC. Premedicate with high-dose steroids and retry rituximab at 10% of standard rate without desensitization\nD. Switch to ofatumumab without further allergy evaluation\nE. Use omalizumab for 3 months before rechallenging with rituximab at full dose", "options": ["Avoid all monoclonal antibodies and use lenalidomide alone", "Perform rapid drug desensitization to rituximab under intensive monitoring", "Premedicate with high-dose steroids and retry rituximab at 10% of standard rate without desensitization", "Switch to ofatumumab without further allergy evaluation", "Use omalizumab for 3 months before rechallenging with rituximab at full dose"], "answer": "B", "answer_index": 1, "explanation": "Positive skin testing and elevated tryptase confirm IgE-mediated anaphylaxis to rituximab; the standard of care when the culprit agent is uniquely needed is a rapid desensitization protocol in a specialized setting. Premedication and slow infusion without desensitization (C) is unsafe in IgE-mediated reactions. Cross-reactivity among anti-CD20 mAbs is unpredictable, so empiric switch to ofatumumab (D) risks repeat anaphylaxis. Omalizumab pretreatment (E) is not a substitute for true desensitization.
