An LI of 2.2 is below this threshold, which would normally suggest bilateral disease or make the result inconclusive.\n\nHowever, the critical finding here is the contralateral suppression index <0.3, which indicates significant suppression of the contralateral adrenal gland. This is actually a favorable finding for unilateral disease and suggests the left side is the source.\n\nThe Problem:\nThe LI of 2.2 is borderline/below traditional cutoff, creating diagnostic uncertainty. The question is whether to proceed with surgery or get more information.\n\nAnalysis of Options:\n\nA. Proceed to surgery - The LI is below traditional cutoff, so this is premature without clarification.\n\nB. Continue medical therapy - This is reasonable given the borderline LI, but doesn't resolve the diagnostic uncertainty.\n\nC. Repeat AVS with cosyntropin stimulation - Cosyntropin stimulation during AVS improves the accuracy and reliability of the test by reducing the impact of adrenal vein catheterization trauma and improving the signal-to-noise ratio. This would help clarify whether there is true unilateral aldosterone production.\n\nD. Partial resection - Not standard approach; full adrenalectomy is typical if surgery is indicated.\n\nE. Observation - The patient has biochemical evidence of primary aldosteronism with imaging findings, so observation alone is not appropriate.\n\nBest Answer:\nGiven the borderline LI of 2.2 (below traditional cutoff) despite favorable contralateral suppression, repeating AVS with cosyntropin stimulation would provide the most reliable data to guide the decision between medical vs. surgical management.\n\nThe answer is C"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p03", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p03-002", "question": "A 63-year-old man with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A, MELD 9) has a 2.3-cm hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in segment VII adjacent to the right hepatic vein and diaphragm.

Tumor characteristics: 2.3 cm is within Milan criteria (single tumor ≤5 cm or up to 3 tumors ≤3 cm each)\n\n2.

Location: Segment VII adjacent to right hepatic vein and diaphragm - technically challenging for resection\n\nEvaluating Options:\n\nA. Open right posterior sectionectomy: Major resection removing segments VII and VIII. While this offers best oncologic control, it risks significant hepatic reserve loss in a patient with portal hypertension. Excessive for a 2.3-cm tumor.\n\nB. Laparoscopic wedge resection: Minimal resection preserves liver, but segment VII location near hepatic vein makes this technically risky with potential for major bleeding.\n\nC. RFA alone: Good for small tumors in preserved liver function. However, 2.3 cm is borderline for RFA efficacy as single modality, and location near hepatic vein increases risk of incomplete ablation.\n\nD. TACE followed by reassessment: Allows downstaging/necrosis of tumor, then reassess for ablation or resection.

Lupus Nephritis (Class IV): Requires aggressive immunosuppression. Standard of care involves corticosteroids + either cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate mofetil.\n\n2. CIDP: Typically treated with IVIG, plasma exchange, or corticosteroids. Can also respond to rituximab.\n\n3. Balancing toxicity: Long-term high-dose prednisone is problematic. Cyclophosphamide has significant toxicity (infertility, malignancy, hemorrhagic cystitis). Need steroid-sparing agents.\n\nEvaluating Options:\n\nA. High-dose methylprednisolone + high-dose oral prednisone (1 mg/kg) - This is excessive steroid exposure for long-term management. High toxicity risk.\n\nB. IVIG + modest prednisone increase - Doesn't adequately address class IV lupus nephritis, which requires more aggressive immunosuppression.\n\nC. Rituximab-based regimen with steroid tapering - Rituximab is effective for both SLE/lupus nephritis AND CIDP. Allows steroid reduction. B-cell depletion addresses both conditions. This is increasingly recognized as a steroid-sparing strategy.\n\nD. Cyclophosphamide + azathioprine - While cyclophosphamide is effective for severe lupus nephritis, it has significant long-term toxicity (infertility, malignancy). Not ideal for a 31-year-old woman.\n\nE. Plasma exchange + MMF - Plasma exchange is not standard for CIDP (IVIG or corticosteroids are first-line). MMF is good for lupus nephritis but doesn't address CIDP well.\n\nBest Answer:\nRituximab offers:\n- Efficacy for both lupus nephritis and CIDP\n- Steroid-sparing potential\n- Better long-term safety profile than cyclophosphamide\n- Allows tapering of prednisone, reducing cumulative steroid toxicity\n- Increasingly used in both conditions\n\nThe answer is C"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p03", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p03-007", "question": "A 38-year-old woman presents with progressive proximal muscle weakness over 6 weeks, difficulty climbing stairs, and new-onset dry cough.
