Traditional LI cutoffs: Without cosyntropin stimulation, the traditional cutoff for lateralization is typically ≥2.0 (some use ≥3.0-4.0 with cosyntropin). Her LI of 2.2 is borderline.\n\n2. Contralateral suppression: This is a crucial finding. A contralateral suppression index <1.0 (and especially <0.3) indicates that the contralateral adrenal is suppressed, which strongly supports unilateral aldosterone hypersecretion. This is considered by many experts to be even more specific for unilateral disease than the LI alone.\n\n3. Concordance with imaging: The AVS suggests left-sided lateralization, which matches the imaging finding of a left adrenal nodule.\n\n4. Without vs. with cosyntropin: Without cosyntropin stimulation, lower LI cutoffs (≥2.0) are generally accepted. The contralateral suppression provides additional confidence.\n\nAnalysis of Options:\n\n- A: Left adrenalectomy - The combination of imaging-concordant lesion AND contralateral suppression (even with borderline LI) supports unilateral disease. Contralateral suppression is highly specific.\n\n- B: Medical therapy only - This would be appropriate if lateralization was truly indeterminate, but contralateral suppression strengthens the case for surgery.\n\n- C: Repeat AVS with cosyntropin - While this could clarify, the contralateral suppression already provides strong evidence of unilateral disease.\n\n- D: Partial resection - Not standard for aldosterone-producing adenomas; complete adrenalectomy is preferred.\n\n- E: Observation - Inappropriate given evidence of primary aldosteronism.\n\nThe contralateral suppression index <0.3 is a strong indicator of unilateral disease, even when the LI is borderline. Combined with imaging concordance, this supports proceeding with surgery.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p03", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p03-002", "question": "A 63-year-old man with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A, MELD 9) has a 2.3-cm hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in segment VII adjacent to the right hepatic vein and diaphragm.

Portal Hypertension Impact: HVPG >10 mmHg (his is 13 mmHg) and platelets <100,000 are relative contraindications to surgical resection due to increased risk of post-hepatectomy liver failure and decompensation.\n\n2. Tumor Characteristics: Single 2.3-cm tumor - within Milan criteria, amenable to curative-intent treatment.\n\n3. Location Challenges: Adjacent to right hepatic vein and diaphragm makes percutaneous RFA technically challenging due to:\n   - Heat-sink effect from hepatic vein\n   - Risk of diaphragmatic injury\n   - Potential for incomplete ablation\n\nOption Analysis:\n\n- A (Open right posterior sectionectomy): Too extensive for a patient with significant portal hypertension (HVPG 13). High risk of decompensation.\n\n- B (Laparoscopic wedge resection): Still carries surgical risk in setting of portal hypertension. The HVPG >10 mmHg is a contraindication per BCLC guidelines.\n\n- C (Percutaneous RFA): Standard treatment for small HCC in patients with portal hypertension. However, the location (adjacent to hepatic vein and diaphragm) is suboptimal - heat-sink effect may reduce efficacy, and there's diaphragmatic injury risk.\n\n- D (TACE followed by reassessment): TACE is typically for intermediate-stage HCC. For a single small tumor, it's not first-line curative treatment. This delays definitive therapy.\n\n- E (Listing without locoregional therapy): Patient has social issues preventing listing, and waiting without treatment risks tumor progression.\n\nBest Answer:\nDespite the challenging location, percutaneous RFA remains the best option for this patient. The portal hypertension (HVPG 13 mmHg) makes surgical resection high-risk. RFA preserves hepatic reserve and provides good oncologic control for tumors <3 cm.

Add finerenone with close potassium monitoring\n- Finerenone is a non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) with proven cardiorenal benefits in diabetic kidney disease (FIDELIO-DKD, FIGARO-DKD trials).

This addresses his residual cardiorenal risk.\n\nC. Replace lisinopril with sacubitril/valsartan\n- Sacubitril/valsartan is indicated for HFrEF. There's no mention of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. While he had NSTEMI, this doesn't automatically indicate HFrEF. Not appropriate without that indication.\n\nD. Add basal insulin to target A1c <6.5%\n- His A1c of 7.2% is reasonable for someone with CKD and cardiovascular disease.
