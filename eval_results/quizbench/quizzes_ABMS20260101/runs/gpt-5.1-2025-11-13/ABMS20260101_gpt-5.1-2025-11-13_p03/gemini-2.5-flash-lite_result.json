The confirmatory saline suppression test being borderline further supports the need for more definitive testing, such as adrenal vein sampling (AVS).\n\nAdrenal vein sampling is the gold standard for differentiating lateralization (unilateral PA from an adenoma or unilateral hyperplasia) from bilateral disease. The AVS results are:\n1.  Left adrenal vein aldosterone: Corrected aldosterone-to-cortisol ratio of 2.2.\n2.  Right adrenal vein aldosterone: Contralateral suppression index of <0.3.\n\nInterpretation of AVS:\n*   Lateralization Index (LI): A ratio greater than 2.0 or 2.5 from the affected side is generally considered indicative of lateralization. The LI of 2.2 is borderline, falling between commonly used cutoffs.\n*   Contralateral Suppression Index (CSI): An index below 0.3 or 0.4 from the contralateral adrenal gland is considered strong evidence of suppression, meaning the contralateral gland is not autonomously producing significant amounts of aldosterone. The CSI of <0.3 for the right adrenal gland is a highly significant finding, indicating profound suppression.\n\nThe combination of a borderline LI (2.2) from the left and strong contralateral suppression (<0.3) from the right is highly suggestive of unilateral aldosterone production from the left adrenal gland. The imaging finding of a left adrenal lesion further supports this conclusion.\n\nHowever, the AVS was performed *without cosyntropin stimulation*. Cosyntropin stimulation is often employed during AVS to standardize testing conditions by boosting ACTH levels, which can enhance aldosterone secretion and improve the accuracy of lateralization detection, particularly when basal AVS results are borderline or equivocal. Many guidelines suggest that AVS with cosyntropin stimulation is the preferred method for optimal diagnostic accuracy, especially when the LI is not clearly high (e.g., >3.0 or >4.0). Given that the LI is borderline (2.2) and stimulation was not used, there is a rationale for repeating the AVS with cosyntropin stimulation to confirm lateralization with greater confidence before proceeding to potentially curative surgery.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA.  Left laparoscopic adrenalectomy, given imaging-concordant unilateral lesion and contralateral suppression: While the findings are highly suggestive, the borderline LI and the use of AVS without stimulation might warrant further confirmation to ensure the decision for surgery is robust.\nB.  Continue medical therapy with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists because lateralization index is below traditional cutoff: The LI is borderline, but the contralateral suppression is strong, strongly favoring unilateral disease, for which surgery is curable. Medical therapy is usually reserved for bilateral disease or when surgery is contraindicated.\nC.  Repeat AVS with cosyntropin stimulation to clarify lateralization before deciding on surgery: This option addresses the potential ambiguity of the borderline LI and the absence of cosyntropin stimulation in the initial AVS. Performing AVS with stimulation would provide more definitive data on lateralization, increasing diagnostic certainty before surgery.\nD.  Proceed to partial (cortical-sparing) resection of the left adrenal nodule to preserve adrenal function: Partial resection is typically reserved for specific situations, not usually for a discrete adenoma causing PA where complete unilateral adrenalectomy is the standard curative treatment if indicated.\nE.  Observation without intervention, as results suggest nonfunctioning incidentaloma: This is incorrect, as the patient has clinical and biochemical evidence of primary aldosteronism.\n\nConsidering that the LI is borderline and cosyntropin stimulation was not used in the initial AVS, repeating the AVS with cosyntropin stimulation (Option C) is the most appropriate next step to definitively clarify lateralization and ensure the most accurate decision-making prior to surgery. This approach prioritizes diagnostic certainty when faced with borderline data that could lead to irreversible intervention.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p03", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p03-002", "question": "A 63-year-old man with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A, MELD 9) has a 2.3-cm hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in segment VII adjacent to the right hepatic vein and diaphragm.

The HCC is 2.3 cm in segment VII. The goals are to balance long-term oncologic control and hepatic reserve preservation.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Open right posterior sectionectomy including segment VII and part of VIII: This is a major surgical resection. While it can provide excellent oncologic control, it carries a high risk of postoperative liver failure or decompensation in a patient with significant portal hypertension, even with Child-Pugh A status and preserved liver function. A sectionectomy is generally reserved for patients with better liver reserve or when less extensive resections are not feasible.\n\nB. Laparoscopic wedge resection of segment VII tumor with Pringle maneuver: A wedge resection is less extensive than a sectionectomy, and laparoscopy offers potential benefits in recovery. However, it still involves surgically removing liver tissue. The risk of decompensation due to portal hypertension remains a concern, though less so than with a sectionectomy. For a 2.3-cm tumor, other curative-intent therapies might be considered.\n\nC. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of the lesion: RFA is a minimally invasive, curative-intent treatment for HCCs < 3 cm. It offers excellent local tumor control and, critically for this patient, preserves the majority of functional liver parenchyma. This is vital given the presence of portal hypertension, where maintaining sufficient liver reserve is paramount. RFA is often preferred over surgery in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension when the tumor is amenable to ablation.\n\nD. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) followed by reassessment for ablation or resection: TACE is generally indicated for unresectable HCC, multifocal disease, or as downstaging prior to transplant. For a single, small, potentially resectable or ablative lesion in a Child-Pugh A patient, TACE is typically not the preferred first-line treatment for curative intent. While it can achieve tumor necrosis, it does not offer the same likelihood of complete eradication as RFA or resection for a lesion of this size and stage, and it has its own potential morbidities.\n\nE. Listing for liver transplantation without locoregional therapy until a donor becomes available: Liver transplantation is the definitive treatment for eligible patients with HCC and cirrhosis. However, waiting for a donor without any locoregional therapy for a 2.3-cm HCC can lead to tumor progression, potentially exceeding transplant criteria (e.g., Milan criteria) and making the patient ineligible. Locoregional therapies are often used to control tumor burden while awaiting transplantation. Therefore, delaying all treatment is not optimal for oncologic control.\n\nConsidering the need to balance oncologic control with hepatic reserve preservation in a patient with compensated cirrhosis but significant portal hypertension, RFA (Option C) is the best choice. It is a curative-intent therapy for this size of tumor and is significantly less invasive than surgery, thus better preserving liver function and reserve.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p03", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p03-003", "question": "A 41-year-old woman presents with progressive exertional dyspnea and chest tightness.

This, along with right ventricular hypertrophy and absent left ventricular dysfunction, confirms PAH. The family history of sudden death at a young age strongly suggests heritable PAH.\n\nThe patient underwent acute vasoreactivity testing with inhaled nitric oxide, which resulted in a reduction of mPAP from 52 to 42 mm Hg and PVR from 10 to 8 Wood units.

Blood pressure is well-controlled, and A1c is 7.2%. He has no history of hyperkalemia, and his current potassium is normal (4.6 mEq/L). The goal is to further reduce cardiorenal risk.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Increase empagliflozin to 25 mg daily: Empagliflozin is an SGLT2 inhibitor, which has demonstrated cardiorenal benefits. Increasing the dose to the maximum approved dose (25 mg) could potentially enhance these benefits. This is a reasonable optimization of existing therapy.\n\nB. Add finerenone with close potassium monitoring: Finerenone is a non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA). It has been shown in large clinical trials (FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD) to significantly reduce cardiorenal endpoints (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for heart failure, and progression of CKD) in patients with type 2 diabetes, CKD, and albuminuria, even when they are already on ACE inhibitors/ARBs and SGLT2 inhibitors. The patient's high albuminuria of 620 mg/g makes him an ideal candidate, and his normal potassium and lack of hyperkalemia history make the addition of finerenone safe to consider with appropriate monitoring. This option targets a key pathway (fibrosis and inflammation mediated by mineralocorticoid receptors) that contributes to cardiorenal damage in diabetic kidney disease.\n\nC. Replace lisinopril with sacubitril/valsartan: Sacubitril/valsartan is an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) primarily indicated for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. While it can be used in other cardiovascular conditions aiming to reduce RAAS activity, replacing an ACE inhibitor with an ARNI is not the primary strategy for further cardiorenal risk reduction in this patient's specific profile of CKD with albuminuria without overt heart failure. ACE inhibitors are foundational for CKD management.\n\nD. Add basal insulin to target A1c <6.5%: The patient's A1c of 7.2% is acceptable for an individual with long-standing diabetes, CKD, and cardiovascular disease, where a target of <6.5% might increase the risk of hypoglycemia, weight gain, and other adverse effects without substantial proven benefit for *further* cardiorenal risk reduction compared to other strategies. The current glycemic control is not the primary driver of his high cardiorenal risk profile compared to the significant albuminuria.\n\nE. Add a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker: Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are not a preferred agent for cardiorenal risk reduction in patients with diabetes and CKD, and their addition would not typically be considered for further risk reduction beyond his current regimen.\n\nComparing options A and B, both are beneficial. However, the patient exhibits significant albuminuria (ACR 620 mg/g), which is a major risk factor for cardiorenal events and CKD progression. Guidelines (e.g., KDIGO 2020) recommend consideration of finerenone for further risk reduction in patients with T2DM, CKD, and albuminuria who are already on existing therapies like ACE inhibitors/ARBs and SGLT2 inhibitors. Adding finerenone addresses a distinct therapeutic pathway (MR antagonism) that is crucial for mitigating fibrosis and inflammation in diabetic kidney disease and has demonstrated significant cardiorenal benefits.

Peripheral smear findings (tear-drop cells, leukoerythroblastosis) and bone marrow biopsy (marked fibrosis, low blasts) are consistent with PMF. The DIPSS-plus score indicates intermediate-2 risk, which is considered high-risk. Multiple adverse prognostic factors are present: significant splenomegaly, anemia, leukoerythroblastosis, and an isolated ASXL1 mutation. ASXL1 mutations are generally associated with a worse prognosis in PMF. The absence of JAK2, CALR, and MPL mutations classifies this as \"triple-negative\" PMF, which can also be associated with a less favorable outcome compared to driver-mutated PMF.\n\nGiven the patient's young age, intermediate-2 risk status, and the availability of a 10/10 HLA-matched sibling donor, allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is the only potentially curative treatment option and should be pursued. The goal is to perform SCT in the \"first chronic phase\" of the disease if possible, which typically implies while the disease is relatively stable and before significant transformation into blast phase.\n\nThe patient is symptomatic from splenomegaly and transfusion independent. Ruxolitinib, a JAK inhibitor, is a standard treatment for symptomatic splenomegaly and constitutional symptoms in PMF. It can improve symptoms, reduce spleen size, and improve quality of life. In patients like this, where SCT is the planned curative therapy, ruxolitinib is often used as \"bridge therapy\" to prepare the patient for transplantation. This involves using ruxolitinib to optimize the patient's condition (reduce spleen size, improve performance status, alleviate symptoms) for 3-6 months prior to SCT. This optimization can lead to better outcomes post-transplant.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. Ruxolitinib is indicated, but deferring SCT until transfusion dependence is not ideal for a young, intermediate-2 risk patient with a donor. Early SCT is preferred if feasible.\nB. Proceeding directly to SCT is a possibility for high-risk patients. However, the symptomatic splenomegaly suggests that optimizing the patient first with ruxolitinib may lead to better transplant outcomes. \"Despite triple-negative driver status\" is a valid consideration; however, it doesn't inherently preclude optimization.\nC. Observation is insufficient for intermediate-2 risk PMF, especially with an ASXL1 mutation and symptomatic splenomegaly, when SCT is a curative option.\nD. Splenectomy is not a disease-modifying treatment and carries significant risks. Hydroxyurea is palliative. This option does not address the curative potential of SCT.\nE. This option combines the benefits of therapy for symptoms (ruxolitinib) with a planned curative approach (SCT). Ruxolitinib addresses the symptomatic splenomegaly, and using it as bridge therapy for 3-6 months aims to optimize the patient for a successful allogeneic SCT. This is a well-established strategy in managing high-risk PMF eligible for transplantation.\n\nTherefore, option E represents the most appropriate management strategy for this patient.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{E}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p03", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p03-006", "question": "A 31-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus, class IV lupus nephritis, and high-titer anti-dsDNA presents with a 4-week history of progressive symmetric lower extremity weakness, areflexia, and sensory loss.

She also has a new-onset demyelinating polyneuropathy consistent with CIDP. The current treatment with low-dose prednisone (10 mg daily) and hydroxychloroquine is insufficient, as evidenced by her ongoing renal disease and the development of CIDP. The goal is to find an immunologic treatment strategy that effectively controls both conditions while minimizing long-term toxicity.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\nA. High-dose IV methylprednisolone pulses followed by oral prednisone 1 mg/kg: While high-dose corticosteroids are a treatment for both severe lupus nephritis and CIDP, maintaining prednisone at 1 mg/kg long-term carries significant risks of toxicity, especially in a young patient. This strategy prioritizes immediate control but compromises long-term toxicity balance.\n\nB. IVIG monthly for CIDP plus increase prednisone to 0.5 mg/kg, with no other agents: IVIG is effective for CIDP and increasing prednisone dose would offer more immunosuppression. However, this option might not provide sufficient immunosuppression for class IV lupus nephritis given the nephrotic-range proteinuria and elevated creatinine, particularly without a more targeted agent for the underlying lupus.\n\nC. Rituximab-based regimen targeting both CIDP and lupus nephritis with tapering of steroids: Rituximab is a B-cell depleting therapy that has demonstrated efficacy in both lupus nephritis and certain autoimmune neuropathies, including CIDP. Its mechanism of action targets the B cells responsible for autoantibody production in SLE. Importantly, rituximab-based regimens are often used in SLE to achieve disease control while allowing for significant reduction or tapering of corticosteroid doses, thereby mitigating long-term steroid toxicity. This approach offers a good balance between potent disease control for both manifestations and improved long-term safety.\n\nD. Cyclophosphamide induction followed by azathioprine maintenance for lupus and CIDP: Cyclophosphamide is a potent immunosuppressant used for severe lupus nephritis, but it carries significant long-term toxicities, including infertility, increased risk of malignancy, and hemorrhagic cystitis. While it can be used for CIDP, it's generally considered second-line due to its toxicity profile, especially when other options are available. Azathioprine is a maintenance agent with its own side effects. This option leans towards aggressive immunosuppression with high potential for long-term harm.\n\nE. Plasma exchange for CIDP plus mycophenolate mofetil for lupus nephritis: Plasma exchange is an effective acute treatment for CIDP and can be used in severe lupus nephritis, but it is not a long-term maintenance therapy for CIDP. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is an excellent agent for lupus nephritis and is a good steroid-sparing drug. However, this option lacks a clear long-term strategy for the CIDP if it becomes chronic or relapses after PLEX is discontinued without other CIDC treatment.\n\nConsidering the need to balance disease control and long-term toxicity for both lupus nephritis and CIDP in a young patient, a rituximab-based regimen (Option C) is the most appropriate choice. It addresses the autoimmune drivers of both conditions, offers a mechanism for steroid sparing, and generally has a more favorable long-term toxicity profile compared to chronic high-dose steroids or cyclophosphamide.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p03", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p03-007", "question": "A 38-year-old woman presents with progressive proximal muscle weakness over 6 weeks, difficulty climbing stairs, and new-onset dry cough.

The patient's description of peripheral ground-glass opacities and traction bronchiectasis on HRCT, along with the severely reduced DLCO, aligns well with severe ILD often seen in anti-MDA5 positive patients.

Neurosurgery has recommended medical therapy unless there is deterioration, acknowledging these risks.\n\nThe patient is already on IV vancomycin, which is appropriate for MRSA. The question asks for the most appropriate *next step*. Since surgery is being deferred due to high risk, optimizing medical therapy is crucial.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Continue IV vancomycin alone with close neurologic monitoring for at least 6 weeks: While monitoring is essential, vancomycin alone might not be sufficient for MRSA osteomyelitis and epidural abscess, particularly with bone involvement. Combination therapy is often preferred.\n\nB. Add rifampin to vancomycin to enhance penetration into epidural space and bone: Rifampin is a key component in treating MRSA osteomyelitis and complicated infections involving bone and biofilms. It achieves excellent concentrations in bone and has synergistic activity with vancomycin. Adding rifampin to vancomycin is a standard strategy to improve efficacy against MRSA in situations like this, especially when bone is involved and surgical drainage is deferred.\n\nC.

There is no specific indication to switch from vancomycin for broader coverage unless there are concerns about resistance or toxicity, which are not mentioned. This option does not inherently improve the treatment strategy over vancomycin plus rifampin for this specific infection pattern.\n\nE. Place percutaneous CT-guided drain into the epidural collection to avoid open surgery: While percutaneous drainage can be an alternative to open surgery in some patients at high risk, it may not be effective for significant canal compromise or loculated collections, and open surgical decompression is often more definitive for relieving pressure on the spinal cord. Moreover, the neurosurgical team recommended medical therapy, suggesting that even less invasive procedures might carry significant risk or be deemed less effective than optimizing medical management if surgery is contraindicated.\n\nGiven the patient's high surgical risk and the decision to manage medically, the best next step is to optimize medical therapy.

Avoiding all monoclonal antibodies and using lenalidomide alone: While lenalidomide can be used in follicular lymphoma, it is not a monoclonal antibody and may not provide the same level of B-cell depletion as anti-CD20 agents. This is a fallback option if other therapies are not feasible.\n\nB. Performing rapid drug desensitization to rituximab under intensive monitoring: Rapid drug desensitization is a proven protocol for administering essential medications to patients who have life-threatening allergies and lack suitable alternatives. Given the patient's anaphylaxis to rituximab and the need for B-cell-depleting therapy, if rituximab is still considered the most appropriate treatment for her lymphoma, desensitization is the safest way to administer it.\n\nC. Premedicating with high-dose steroids and retrying rituximab at a lower rate: Standard premedication and slowing the infusion rate are appropriate for managing mild to moderate infusion reactions. However, for confirmed anaphylaxis, this approach is insufficient and carries a high risk of severe recurrence. The option explicitly states \"without desensitization,\" making it inadequate.\n\nD. Switching to ofatumumab without further allergy evaluation: Ofatumumab is another anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that targets a different epitope on CD20 compared to rituximab and obinutuzumab. While there is a theoretical possibility of tolerating it, cross-reactivity with monoclonal antibodies, especially within the same class, can occur. Switching without any allergy evaluation (e.g., skin testing or a graded challenge) after a severe reaction to a related drug (rituximab) and therapeutic failure of another (obinutuzumab) is not the most appropriate or safest management.\n\nE. Using omalizumab for 3 months before rechallenging with rituximab: Omalizumab is an anti-IgE antibody used for allergic conditions but is not a desensitization therapy for monoclonal antibodies like rituximab. This approach is not standard and does not guarantee safety upon rechallenge.\n\nConsidering the patient's confirmed anaphylaxis to rituximab and her ongoing need for B-cell-depleting therapy, rapid drug desensitization to rituximab is the most appropriate management strategy among the given options. It allows for the administration of a necessary medication despite a severe allergy. The failure of obinutuzumab makes the situation more complex, but desensitization to rituximab directly addresses her allergy to that specific drug.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."}]
