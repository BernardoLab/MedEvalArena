The CT scan shows a left adrenal nodule. The critical next step is determining whether the aldosterone excess is unilateral (surgically curable) or bilateral (managed medically) using the Adrenal Vein Sampling (AVS) results.\n\n1.  Interpretation of AVS:\n    *   Lateralization Index (LI): This compares the aldosterone/cortisol ratio of the dominant side to the non-dominant side. An LI $>4$ is definitely indicative of unilateral disease. An LI between 2 and 4 (here it is 2.2) is considered an intermediate or \"gray zone\" result.\n    *   Contralateral Suppression Index (CSI): This compares the aldosterone/cortisol ratio of the non-dominant (contralateral) side to the peripheral blood. In unilateral PA, the high levels of aldosterone suppress renin, which in turn suppresses aldosterone production in the *normal* (contralateral) gland. A CSI $< 1$ (and especially $< 0.3$) indicates that the contralateral gland is suppressed.\n\n2.  Clinical Decision Making:\n    *   While the LI of 2.2 is in the intermediate range, the Contralateral Suppression Index of <0.3 is strongly suggestive of unilateral disease. Ideally, in bilateral hyperplasia, the contralateral gland would not be suppressed to this degree relative to the periphery.\n    *   Combined with a concordant anatomical lesion (1.7-cm left nodule) and the suppression of the right gland, the diagnosis points to a left aldosterone-producing adenoma.\n    *   Studies have shown that patients with \"gray zone\" lateralization (LI 2-4) who show contralateral suppression and have a concordant visual nodule usually achieve cure or significant improvement of hypertension after adrenalectomy, similar to those with LI >4.\n\n3.  Why other options are incorrect:\n    *   B: Since the data supports unilateral disease (due to significant contralateral suppression and concordant imaging), medical therapy is not the *best* next step for a 45-year-old surgical candidate who could be cured.\n    *   C: Repeating AVS is invasive and carries risks. Because the contralateral suppression index effectively confirms that the right gland is not participating in the excess secretion, there is sufficient evidence to proceed to surgery without repeating the test.\n    *   D: Partial adrenalectomy is generally reserved for patients with bilateral tumors, solitary adrenal glands, or hereditary syndromes hoping to preserve some cortical function. For a unilateral adenoma with a normal contralateral gland, total unilateral adrenalectomy is the standard of care to minimize recurrence risk.\n    *   E: The results (suppressed renin, elevated aldosterone, clinical phenotype) confirm PA; this is not a nonfunctioning incidentaloma.\n\nTherefore, the patient should undergo a left adrenalectomy.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p03", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p03-002", "question": "A 63-year-old man with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A, MELD 9) has a 2.3-cm hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in segment VII adjacent to the right hepatic vein and diaphragm.

Transplantation (Option E): This would be the ideal treatment (curing both the tumor and the cirrhosis), but the patient is not listed due to social issues.\n3.  Ablation (Option C): Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is the standard of care for BCLC Stage A (early) patients with solitary tumors < 3 cm who are not candidates for resection due to portal hypertension. While the tumor's location adjacent to the right hepatic vein (\"heat sink\" effect) and diaphragm makes percutaneous ablation technically challenging, it remains the preferred curative intent modality over palliative therapies. Techniques such as hydrodissection or overlapping fields can mitigate these difficulties.\n4.  TACE (Option D): Transarterial chemoembolization is the standard for intermediate-stage (BCLC B) disease or for patients who are not candidates for resection, transplant, or ablation. Since ablation is the standard curative option for this stage and preserves liver function, TACE is generally reserved for cases where ablation is technically impossible or has failed. It does not offer the same long-term oncologic control (cure) as ablation for small lesions.\n\nTherefore, despite the challenging location, RFA offers the best balance of attempting a curative treatment (oncologic control) while minimizing the risk of liver decompensation (hepatic reserve preservation) in a patient with significant portal hypertension.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p03", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p03-003", "question": "A 41-year-old woman presents with progressive exertional dyspnea and chest tightness.

High-dose amlodipine monotherapy: Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs) are indicated *only* for patients who are vasoreactive responders. Using CCBs in non-responders can be detrimental (causing hypotension and worsening right heart failure). Thus, this is incorrect.\n*   B. Combination therapy with ambrisentan and tadalafil: Current guidelines (e.g., ESC/ERS) recommend initial combination therapy (usually an Endothelin Receptor Antagonist [ERA] + a Phosphodiesterase-5 Inhibitor [PDE5i]) for patients with PAH who are at low-to-intermediate risk. This patient has an RA pressure of 6 mmHg (low risk marker) and a Cardiac Index of 2.1 L/min/m² (intermediate risk marker), placing her generally in the intermediate risk category.

Management of Class IV Lupus Nephritis: The standard of care for induction therapy in Class IV nephritis is either Cyclophosphamide (CYC) or Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF), usually combined with corticosteroids. In women of childbearing age (the patient is 31), MMF is generally preferred over CYC to minimize the risk of infertility (gonadotoxicity) and long-term malignancy, provided it is effective. The ALMS trial demonstrated that MMF is non-inferior to CYC for induction and superior to Azathioprine for maintenance, with a better safety profile regarding ovarian failure.\n\n2.  Management of SLE-associated CIDP: Current guidelines for the treatment of CIDP (often adopted for SLE-associated cases) recommend IVIG, Plasma Exchange (PLEX), or high-dose Corticosteroids as first-line therapies for the neuropathy. While Cyclophosphamide is used for severe refractory neurological SLE, it carries higher toxicity.\n\n3.  Evaluating the Options:\n    *   A: High-dose steroids alone are generally insufficient for inducing remission in Class IV nephritis and maintaining renal function long-term.\n    *   B: IVIG treats the CIDP but does not adequately address the Class IV lupus nephritis (which requires MMF or CYC). Increasing prednisone to 0.5 mg/kg is typically sub-therapeutic for induction of diffuse proliferative nephritis.\n    *   C: Rituximab is often used for refractory cases of nephritis or neuropathy but is not currently the standard first-line induction agent for Class IV nephritis compared to MMF or CYC.\n    *   D: Cyclophosphamide is effective for both nephritis and severe neurological involvement. However, it carries significant long-term risks (infertility, malignancy). Azathioprine is also generally considered inferior to MMF for lupus nephritis maintenance. Given the patient's age, avoiding alkylating agents if possible is a key part of \"balancing toxicity.\"\n    *   E: Plasma exchange is an effective, rapid acting first-line therapy for the severe demyelinating neuropathy (CIDP). Mycophenolate mofetil is the preferred induction agent for Class IV nephritis in this demographic due to its favorable toxicity profile compared to cyclophosphamide (renal efficacy is comparable). This strategy addresses both severe organ manifestations effectively while sparing the patient the gonadotoxicity of cyclophosphamide.\n\nTherefore, Option E provides the best balance of disease control for both conditions and long-term toxicity preservation.\n\nThe answer is (E)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p03", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p03-007", "question": "A 38-year-old woman presents with progressive proximal muscle weakness over 6 weeks, difficulty climbing stairs, and new-onset dry cough.

He was found to have a new MET amplification (copy number 9) upon progression.\n\n1.  Standard of Care Considerations: The FDA-approved targeted therapies for KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC in the second-line setting (post-platinum/IO) are sotorasib and adagrasib. Standard cytotoxic chemotherapy (e.g., docetaxel with or without ramucirumab) is also a valid standard option.\n2.  Impact of MET Amplification: MET amplification is a known mechanism of resistance to KRAS G12C inhibitors (both intrinsic and acquired). The amplification of MET activates downstream signaling pathways (such as PI3K/AKT and MAPK) independently of KRAS, thereby creating a bypass track that renders KRAS G12C inhibition ineffective.\n3.  Evaluating Option B (Adagrasib Monotherapy): Because of the high-level MET amplification (copy number 9) acting as a bypass resistance mechanism, the patient is highly likely to be refractory to adagrasib monotherapy. Therefore, starting adagrasib alone is not the best strategy as the resistance mechanism is already present.\n4.  Evaluating Option A (Docetaxel/Ramucirumab): This is a standard second-line chemotherapy option. It is a reasonable choice if no targeted options are available. However, in the context of precision oncology and board examinations, when a specific targetable resistance driver (MET amplification) is identified, a strategy attempting to target that biology is preferred over generic chemotherapy.\n5.

While not yet FDA-approved as a combination, clinical trials (e.g., investigating sotorasib or adagrasib in combination with crizotinib or other MET inhibitors) satisfy the NCCN preference for clinical trial enrollment when actionable drivers or resistance mechanisms are identified.
