Damage control is appropriate for contaminated/septic cases\n2. Fascial closure should be attempted when:\n   - Patient is physiologically stable\n   - Contamination is controlled\n   - Edema has resolved\n   - Fasciae can be approximated without excessive tension\n\n3. Timing: Early fascial closure (within 7-10 days) reduces complications like enteroatmospheric fistula and infection\n\nEvaluating Each Option:\n\nA. Primary fascial closure at next re-exploration - This aligns with the patient's current status. He's stable, contamination is controlled, edema is reduced, and fasciae can be approximated. This is the goal of damage control surgery.\n\nB. Defer until extubation - Unnecessary delay. The patient is already improving on ventilator support. Waiting increases risk of complications (fistula, infection, loss of domain).\n\nC. Permanent synthetic mesh - Not appropriate for contaminated fields. Synthetic mesh in contaminated/dirty cases has high infection rates.\n\nD. Component separation with biologic mesh - Overly complex for a patient who can achieve primary fascial closure. Reserved for cases where primary closure isn't possible.\n\nE. Skin-only closure - This creates a planned ventral hernia, which is a last resort when fascial closure cannot be achieved. Not indicated here since fasciae CAN be approximated.\n\nConclusion:\nThe patient meets all criteria for fascial closure: hemodynamic stability, controlled contamination, reduced edema, and approximable fasciae under moderate tension.
