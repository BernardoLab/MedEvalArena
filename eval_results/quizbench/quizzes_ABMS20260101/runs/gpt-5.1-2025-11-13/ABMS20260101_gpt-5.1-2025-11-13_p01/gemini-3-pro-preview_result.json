Clinical Phenotype: The history of decreased fetal movements and polyhydramnios (due to poor swallowing) indicates severe prenatal weakness. The presence of arthrogryposis (club feet) confirms immobility in utero. The exam shows facial diplegia, which is a critical distinguishing feature. Classic Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA Type 1) typically presents with sparing of the facial muscles (\"bright, alert face\"). However, SMA Type 0 (the most severe form with prenatal onset) presents with severe weakness, respiratory failure, arthrogryposis, and facial diplegia/ophthalmoplegia.\n2.  Diagnostic Findings:\n    *   CK is normal: This helps make primary dystrophies less likely (though congenital myopathies also have normal CK).\n    *   EMG: Shows \"decreased compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) with normal sensory responses, and nerve conduction velocities are normal.\" This pattern—low CMAP amplitude with preserved sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) and normal conduction velocity—is the hallmark electrophysiological signature of motor neuron disease (anterior horn cell degeneration) or severe motor axonal loss. It signifies that the sensory nerves are intact (ruling out sensorimotor neuropathies) and the pathology is in the motor unit.\n3.  Ruling out other options:\n    *   B (Congenital Myotonic Dystrophy): While this condition causes hypotonia, club feet, and facial diplegia, it is almost exclusively inherited from an affected mother (who would show signs like myotonia or cataracts). The EMG in neonates is often non-specific or myopathic; myotonic discharges are usually absent. The \"neurogenic\" EMG pattern described favoring motor neuron loss makes this less likely.\n    *   C (CMS - ChAT deficiency): This typically presents with episodic apnea. While hypotonia can be present, the severe fixed weakness leading to arthrogryposis and the specific EMG findings of axonal loss (low CMAP) do not fit the classic episodic presentation of ChAT deficiency.\n    *   D (Critical Illness Polyneuropathy): This is an acquired condition following sepsis/multiorgan failure. This patient was symptomatic at birth/in utero.\n    *   E (Congenital Myopathy): While Nemaline myopathy causes hypotonia and facial weakness, the EMG typically shows myopathic changes (small, short-duration potentials with full recruitment), not the pattern of denervation (decreased CMAPs due to motor unit loss) seen in SMA.\n4.  Regarding \"SMA Type 0\": The clinical picture fits SMA Type 0 perfectly. While SMA Type 0 is classically associated with 1 copy of *SMN2* (0 copies is usually embryonic lethal), test questions frequently associate the severe \"Type 0\" phenotype with the most minimal genotype (\"no copies\" or \"1 copy\") to distinguish it from Type 1 (2 copies).

The key differentiating features are the vertical nystagmus (highly specific for PCP or ketamine), severe agitation (\"excited delirium\"), hypertension, tachycardia, hyperthermia, and generalized hypertonia. The patient also has laboratory evidence of rhabdomyolysis (elevated CK) and mild metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to intense muscle activity.\n\nHere is an analysis of the options:\n\n*   A. Administer IV dantrolene... Malignant Hyperthermia (MH) is a genetic disorder triggered by volatile anesthetics (like halothane/sevoflurane) or succinylcholine. It does not present with nystagmus and is not associated with smoking street drugs. Dantrolene is not indicated.\n*   B. Rapid sequence intubation with succinylcholine... While intubation may become necessary if sedation fails to control hyperthermia and agitation, succinylcholine is generally contraindicated or used with extreme caution in patients with hyperthermia and rhabdomyolysis due to the risk of exacerbating hyperkalemia (which can cause cardiac arrest) and potentially worsening undifferentiated hyperthermia/rigidity syndromes (like MH). Non-depolarizing agents (e.g., rocuronium) are preferred.\n*   C. High-dose IV benzodiazepines and active cooling while avoiding physical restraints. This is the correct management. Benzodiazepines are the first-line treatment for PCP intoxication and sympathomimetic toxicity. They control agitation, reduce muscle tone (treating the rhabdomyolysis source), reduce heat production, and prevent seizures. Active cooling is crucial for significant hyperthermia (39.2°C). Physical restraints should be minimized (subject to staff safety) because struggling against restraints increases isometric muscle contraction, worsening lactate production, hyperthermia, and rhabdomyolysis. Chemical restraint is preferred.\n*   D. IV cyproheptadine... This suggests a diagnosis of Serotonin Syndrome. While there is overlap in symptoms, vertical nystagmus strongly favors PCP. Furthermore, cyproheptadine is only available in oral form, making \"IV cyproheptadine\" an incorrect intervention.\n*   E. Lorazepam and IV haloperidol... While lorazepam is correct, antipsychotics like haloperidol lower the seizure threshold (a risk in tox cases), can impair heat dissipation (anticholinergic effects), and may worsen anticholinergic toxicity if that were the cause. In severe agitation with hyperthermia, monotherapy with high-dose benzodiazepines is generally the safer and preferred first-line approach.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p01-003", "question": "A 51-year-old woman with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes and prior pelvic radiation for cervical cancer presents with 5 days of fever, worsening lower abdominal pain, and foul vaginal discharge.

Key features include \"crepitus,\" \"gas tracking along fascial planes,\" and \"necrotic friable tissue.\"\n\n1.  Diagnosis: This is a surgical emergency. The presence of gas tracking along fascial planes and tissue necrosis characterizes necrotizing fasciitis.

Patient Physiology: The patient has severe aortic stenosis (AS) (AVA 0.7 cm², mean gradient 52 mmHg) and HFpEF with concentric LVH.\n    *   Fixed Obstruction: The stenotic valve prevents the left ventricle from increasing stroke volume (SV) in response to vasodilation or increased demand.\n    *   LV Hypertrophy & Diastolic Dysfunction: The LV is thickened and stiff (non-compliant). It is highly dependent on the \"atrial kick\" (active atrial contraction) for filling.\n    *   Myocardial Oxygen Balance: The hypertrophied muscle has high oxygen demand. Oxygen supply depends on coronary perfusion pressure (CPP). Because intraventricular pressures are very high, CPP is compromised, especially if systemic diastolic pressure falls or heart rate increases.\n\n2.  Hemodynamic Goals for Severe AS (\"Slow, Sinus, and Tight\"):\n    *   Heart Rate: Slow to normal (60-80 bpm). Tachycardia is poorly tolerated because it reduces the time for diastolic filling and coronary perfusion while increasing oxygen demand.\n    *   Rhythm: Sinus rhythm. Loss of the atrial kick (e.g., atrial fibrillation) can reduce LV filling by 30-40% or more in non-compliant ventricles, causing hemodynamic collapse.\n    *   Preload: Maintain/Full. A stiff ventricle requires higher filling pressures to maintain stroke volume (Frank-Starling mechanism). Hypovolemia causes a sharp drop in cardiac output.\n    *   Afterload (SVR): Maintain (High-normal). While reducing afterload is beneficial in many heart failure states, in severe AS, the systemic vascular resistance maintains the coronary perfusion pressure. Vasodilation causes hypotension, which the heart cannot compensate for by increasing flow, leading to myocardial ischemia.\n\n3.  Evaluating the Options:\n    *   A. Maintain a relatively high-normal systemic vascular resistance and sinus rhythm with slow-normal heart rate: This aligns perfectly with the goals. Maintaining SVR protects coronary perfusion; sinus rhythm ensures atrial kick; slow-normal rate optimizes filling time and oxygen supply/demand balance.\n    *   B. Use vasodilatory anesthetic agents and permissive hypotension: This is dangerous. Vasodilation leads to hypotension, compromising coronary perfusion. The fixed valve prevents a compensatory increase in cardiac output.\n    *   C. Allow mild tachycardia: This is detrimental. Tachycardia increases oxygen consumption and reduces diastolic perfusion time, risking ischemia.\n    *   D. Aggressively diurese: This reduces preload. A stiff, hypertrophied ventricle needs adequate volume to fill. Aggressive diuresis can precipitate low cardiac output.\n    *   E. Target low preload and low SVR: This combines two dangerous strategies (hypovolemia and hypotension) for this specific pathophysiology. This strategy is more appropriate for mitral regurgitation or dilated cardiomyopathy.\n\nConclusion: The classic management strategy for severe aortic stenosis is effectively summarized as maintaining adequate preload, sinus rhythm, rate control to avoid tachycardia, and maintenance of systemic vascular resistance to ensure coronary perfusion pressure.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p01-005", "question": "A 23-year-old man with treatment-resistant schizophrenia is receiving clozapine 350 mg/day.

The primary goal in managing an open abdomen is to achieve early primary fascial closure whenever possible, as this facilitates weaning from mechanical ventilation, reduces the catabolic state, and prevents long-term complications such as giant ventral hernias, fistulas, and loss of abdominal domain.\n\nHere is an analysis of the options:\n\n*   A. Proceed with primary fascial closure at the next planned re-exploration: This is the correct choice. The patient’s physiological status has improved (normalized lactate, adequate urine output, decreasing ventilator/pressor requirements), and local conditions are favorable (reduced bowel edema, no ongoing contamination). Crucially, the fascial edges can be approximated. While there is \"moderate tension,\" primary closure is the gold standard if it can be achieved without precipitating abdominal compartment syndrome. Closing the abdomen now prevents the fascia from retracting laterally (which leads to a \"frozen abdomen\") and avoids the morbidity of a planned ventral hernia.\n*   B. Defer fascial closure... until extubation: Delaying fascial closure unnecessarily increases the risk of fascial retraction and loss of domain. Extubation is often facilitated *by* closing the abdomen (improving thoracoabdominal mechanics), provided intra-abdominal hypertension is avoided. Waiting risks missing the window of opportunity for primary closure.\n*   C. Place a permanent bridged synthetic mesh: Placing permanent synthetic mesh in a contaminated field (perforated diverticulitis, CDC Class III/IV) is generally contraindicated due to the high risk of mesh infection. Bridging is typically reserved for cases where fascial approximation is impossible.\n*   D. Perform component separation: While component separation can relieve tension, performing extensive dissection in the acute setting (POD 3) after peritonitis carries significant risks of wound complications and infection. It is generally reserved for definitive reconstruction at a later stage or when primary closure is impossible but coverage is mandatory. Simple primary closure is preferred if feasible.\n*   E. Convert to skin-only closure: This results in a large planned ventral hernia. This is a \"bailout\" strategy used when the fascia *cannot* be closed due to edema or retraction. Since the fascia can be approximated, this option is inferior and subjects the patient to significant future morbidity and reconstructive surgery.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p01-007", "question": "A 32-year-old man presents with acute, painless decrease in vision in his right eye over 24 hours.

Diagnosis: The patient presents with unilateral optic disc edema, a macular star (lipid exudates in Henle's layer), and peripapillary hemorrhages. This triad, combined with vitritis, is the classic presentation of neuroretinitis. The history of cat contact and the specific serology (positive IgM and IgG for *Bartonella henselae*) confirm the diagnosis of Cat Scratch Disease (CSD) Neuroretinitis.\n\n2.  Pathophysiology: This is an infectious process caused by *B. henselae* which triggers an inflammatory response affecting the optic nerve and retina.\n\n3.  Treatment Principles:\n    *   Antibiotics: While systemic CSD (lymphadenopathy) is often self-limiting, ocular involvement (neuroretinitis) usually warrants antibiotic therapy to shorten the disease course and prevent complications, given the risk of permanent visual deficits. *Bartonella* species are intracellular bacteria. Treatment regimens typically include drugs with good intracellular and CNS/ocular penetration. Doxycycline is the primary agent used. Rifampin is frequently added as a synergistic agent for hepato-splenic or CNS/ocular disease.\n    *   Corticosteroids: Because the vision loss is largely due to the inflammatory response (edema, vitritis), systemic corticosteroids are often used as adjunctive therapy to speed up visual recovery. However, steroids should never be used as monotherapy without antibiotic cover in the setting of an active bacterial infection, as this could worsen the infection.\n\n4.  Evaluating the Options:\n    *   A: Steroids without antibiotics are contraindicated in active infection.\n    *   B: Oral doxycycline plus rifampin with a short course of systemic corticosteroids constitutes the most commonly recommended aggressive therapy for CSD neuroretinitis to address both the infection and the sight-threatening inflammation.\n    *   C: Anti-VEGF is used for choroidal neovascularization (a rare late complication), not acute neuroretinitis.\n    *   D: Topical steroids do not penetrate sufficiently to the posterior segment/optic nerve to treat neuroretinitis effectively.\n    *   E: Observation is an option for mild cases, but with \"decrease in vision\" and \"moderate vitritis,\" active treatment is generally preferred to improve outcomes.

The MRI findings (\"peel-back lesion\" and \"patulous anterior-inferior capsule\") combined with the physical exam (pain in late cocking, increased ER) suggest that the anterior capsular laxity allows for anterior humeral translation, aggravating the peel-back force on the superior labrum during the late cocking phase.\n\n2.  Evaluating Options:\n    *   Option A (Open Bankart): This is typically reserved for recurrent traumatic anterior instability with significant structural damage or failed arthroscopic measures. It is too invasive and stiffness-inducing for a primary repair in a pitcher with microinstability.\n    *   Option B (Arthroscopic SLAP repair with selective anteroinferior capsular plication): This strategy addresses the two primary structural issues identified: the unstable superior labrum and the pathologic capsular redundancy. Stabilizing the SLAP lesion resists the peel-back force, and plicating the patulous capsule addresses the microinstability that contributes to the pathology. While return-to-play rates for SLAP repairs in pitchers are variable, this is the most anatomically appropriate surgical intervention for a young pitcher with these specific findings who has failed rehab.\n    *   Option C (Isolated biceps tenodesis): While biceps tenodesis is gaining popularity for SLAP lesions due to easier rehab and lack of stiffness, it is controversial in a 19-year-old elite pitcher as a primary option without addressing the confirmed capsular laxity.

This confirms a high-output state consistent with the vasodilatory physiology of cirrhosis (low systemic vascular resistance) and potential relative hypovolemia (despite resuscitation).\n\nWe must evaluate the options for a third vasopressor strategy:\n\nA. Add epinephrine infusion targeting higher MAP (70-75 mm Hg): Epinephrine stimulates beta-adrenergic receptors, which would increase heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand in a patient who is already hyperdynamic. Furthermore, epinephrine increases lactate production, confounding the monitoring of shock resolution. Critically, in patients with acute variceal hemorrhage, targeting a higher MAP (like 70-75 mm Hg) increases portal pressure and the risk of re-bleeding. Goals are typically 60-65 mm Hg.\n\nB. Add low-dose dobutamine: Dobutamine is an inotrope. This patient has hyperdynamic LV function (supranormal contractility), so adding an inotrope is physiologically inappropriate and may worsen hypotension through beta-2 mediated vasodilation.\n\nC. Add angiotensin II infusion while maintaining current MAP target: Angiotensin II (ATII) is a non-catecholamine vasopressor indicated for vasodilatory shock. The ATHOS-3 trial demonstrated its efficacy in raising blood pressure in catecholamine-resistant shock. A subgroup analysis of ATHOS-3 showed a survival benefit significantly in patients with high-output shock and AKI requiring RRT, which matches this patient's profile perfectly. ATII increases SVR without increasing cardiac output or lactate. \"Maintaining current MAP target\" (likely ~65 mm Hg) is the correct strategy to balance perfusion with the risk of increasing portal hypertension/re-bleeding.\n\nD. Increase vasopressin above 0.04 units/min: Vasopressin doses >0.03-0.04 units/min are generally not recommended in shock due to the high risk of splanchnic, coronary, and peripheral ischemia. While terlipressin (a V1 analogue) is used for HRS/variceal bleeding, simply dialing up a vasopressin infusion beyond standard shock doses is not the correct next step compared to adding a synergistic third agent.\n\nE. Switch norepinephrine to phenylephrine: Switching from norepinephrine (first-line) to phenylephrine is generally not indicated unless there are severe tachydysrhythmias directly attributable to NE. Phenylephrine reduces cardiac output (via increased afterload without inotropy) and is less effective in septic/distributive shock outcomes compared to NE.\n\nTherefore, adding Angiotensin II is the most evidence-based and physiologically appropriate choice, particularly given the patient's AKI on CRRT.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p01-010", "question": "A 27-year-old man presents with a first generalized tonic-clonic seizure.

Seizure Types: Generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) and myoclonic jerks (specifically on awakening).\n3.  EEG Findings: Generalized spike-and-wave discharges (3-4 Hz is typical for idiopathic generalized epilepsies) and a photoparoxysmal response.\n4.  Normal MRI: Consistent with an idiopathic (genetic) etiology.\n\nAnalysis of Options:\n\n*   A. Valproate (Valproic Acid): This is the drug of choice (first-line) for JME in men. It has the broadest spectrum of efficacy, covering absence, myoclonic, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The SANAD II trial (2021) reinforced that valproate is superior to levetiracetam and lamotrigine in achieving seizure remission for generalized epilepsies. While it is highly teratogenic and often avoided in women of childbearing potential, this patient is male. Current guidelines generally do not view paternal valproate use as a contraindication for conception (although emerging research is being monitored, it is not established clinical dogma to avoid it in men like it is for women). Regarding cognitive side effects, valproate generally has a favorable cognitive profile compared to older AEDs (like phenobarbital) and specifically topiramate.\n*   B. Levetiracetam: This is a common alternative to valproate, especially for women of childbearing age. However, studies (such as SANAD II) suggest it is less effective than valproate for generalized epilepsy. While it has a good cognitive profile, it is associated with behavioral side effects (irritability, mood changes). Given the patient is male, valproate is preferred for its superior efficacy.\n*   C. Carbamazepine: This is a sodium channel blocker used for focal epilepsy. It is contraindicated in JME and other generalized epilepsies because it can exacerbate myoclonic and absence seizures.\n*   D. Lamotrigine: While lamotrigine has an excellent cognitive profile, it is less effective than valproate for JME. Crucially, lamotrigine is known to potentially exacerbate myoclonic jerks in patients with JME. Since this patient has prominent myoclonic jerks, lamotrigine is not the best initial monotherapy.\n*   E. Topiramate: While effective for generalized seizures, topiramate is well-known for significant cognitive side effects, including psychomotor slowing, word-finding difficulties, and memory impairment (often nicknamed \"Dopamax\"). Since the patient is a software engineer who explicitly wants to avoid cognitive side effects, this is an inappropriate choice.\n\nConclusion:\nValproate is the most appropriate monotherapy because it provides the highest likelihood of seizure freedom for the specific seizure types described (GTCS and myoclonus) and is the standard of care for JME in men. The patient's preference to avoid cognitive side effects specifically rules out Topiramate.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}]
