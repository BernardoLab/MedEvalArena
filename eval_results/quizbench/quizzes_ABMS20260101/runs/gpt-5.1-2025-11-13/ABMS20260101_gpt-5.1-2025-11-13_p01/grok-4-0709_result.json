He and his partner plan to conceive in the next year, and he wants to avoid cognitive side effects. Which antiepileptic monotherapy is most appropriate?", "options": ["Valproate", "Levetiracetam", "Carbamazepine", "Lamotrigine", "Topiramate"], "answer": "B", "answer_index": 1, "explanation": "This is juvenile myoclonic epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic and myoclonic seizures plus characteristic EEG. While valproate is highly effective, its teratogenicity, metabolic effects, and cognitive risks make it less desirable in a young adult planning pregnancy with a partner and with concerns about adverse effects. Levetiracetam is effective for generalized epilepsies, has a favorable cognitive profile, and minimal drug interactions; carbamazepine can worsen generalized seizures, and lamotrigine/topiramate are less predictably effective for myoclonus.", "generator_model": "gpt-5.1-2025-11-13", "seed": 123, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "target_topic": "Neurology", "abms_specialty": "Neurology", "abms_source": "topics_mapped", "source_label_raw": "Neurology", "source_quiz_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed123", "source_question_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed123-003", "source_runs_root": "/home/dbernardo/Documents/pyres/MedEvalArena/eval_results/quizbench/quizzes_Jan2026/runs", "source_run_dir": "/home/dbernardo/Documents/pyres/MedEvalArena/eval_results/quizbench/quizzes_Jan2026/runs/gpt-5.1-2025-11-13/20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed123", "source_quiz_path": "/home/dbernardo/Documents/pyres/MedEvalArena/quizzes/quizzes_Jan2026_backup/20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed123.jsonl", "pred": "B", "model_outputs": "The answer is (B)"}]
