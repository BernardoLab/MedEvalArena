The pregnancy history of polyhydramnios and decreased fetal movements suggests significant prenatal impairment of fetal motility and swallowing. Bilateral club feet can be a manifestation of fetal akinesia or arthrogryposis.\n\nThe electrodiagnostic findings are crucial:\n- Normal CK: This is less suggestive of a primary myopathy (like option E) where CK is often elevated, although normal CK can be seen in some congenital myopathies.\n- EMG shows decreased compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) with normal sensory responses and normal nerve conduction velocities (NCVs). This pattern strongly points towards a problem at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) or severe motor neuron loss affecting terminal axons.\n    - Normal NCVs rule out primary demyelinating neuropathies.\n    - Normal sensory responses rule out significant sensory neuropathy.\n    - Decreased CMAPs suggest either a reduced number of activated motor units or a reduced signal strength from each activated motor unit.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Spinal muscular atrophy type 0 (SMA type 0): This is a severe anterior horn cell (AHC) disease. Profound hypotonia, weakness, respiratory failure, and areflexia are characteristic. Decreased fetal movements and polyhydramnios can occur due to severe intrauterine weakness. EMG in SMA typically shows reduced motor unit potentials, reduced recruitment, and fibrillations, often with reduced CMAP amplitudes due to motor unit loss. So, SMA type 0 can present with decreased CMAPs. However, the EMG finding of \"decreased CMAPs with normal sensory responses and normal NCVs\" is highly specific for disorders affecting neuromuscular transmission. While severe AHC loss can lead to reduced output, NMJ disorders are often the primary consideration for this specific EMG pattern when other findings are not clearly denervative.\n\nB. Congenital myotonic dystrophy: Presents with severe hypotonia, weakness, facial diplegia, and respiratory distress. However, the hallmark EMG finding is myotonia, which is not mentioned. While weakness is present, the specific EMG findings described here are not typical for myotonic dystrophy.\n\nC. Congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS): This is a group of genetic disorders affecting NMJ transmission. Symptoms include congenital hypotonia, weakness, ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, dysphagia, and respiratory distress. The described EMG findings (decreased CMAPs with normal NCVs and sensory responses) are highly characteristic of NMJ disorders, indicating impaired transmission of the signal from the nerve to the muscle. Presynaptic CMS, such as that due to choline acetyltransferase (CHAT) deficiency, leads to reduced acetylcholine synthesis and release, directly causing reduced CMAP amplitudes. The negative response to edrophonium is atypical for some NMJ disorders (like transient neonatal myasthenia gravis or some forms of postsynaptic CMS), but response can be variable in congenital forms, and it does not exclude presynaptic CMS where the amount of initial ACh release is severely limited. Given the EMG pattern, CMS is a strong candidate.\n\nD. Neonatal critical illness polyneuropathy (NCIP): This is an acquired condition, typically seen in critically ill infants with sepsis or multi-organ failure. While EMG can show decreased CMAPs with normal NCVs, NCIP is not a congenital diagnosis presenting at 2 hours of life without evidence of prior critical illness.\n\nE. Congenital myopathy due to ACTA1 mutation: Congenital myopathies are primary muscle disorders. EMG usually shows myopathic changes (short duration, low-amplitude motor unit potentials) rather than reduced CMAPs as the primary abnormality. CK is often elevated.\n\nComparing options A and C: Both SMA type 0 and CMS can cause profound weakness and present with similar clinical symptoms and pregnancy complications. However, the EMG finding of \"decreased compound muscle action potentials with normal sensory responses, and nerve conduction velocities are normal\" is a more direct indicator of a neuromuscular junction transmission deficit than solely denervation. A presynaptic CMS, like CHAT deficiency, directly explains the reduced CMAPs because the amount of neurotransmitter released is insufficient to elicit a full muscle action potential. While SMA type 0 would eventually lead to reduced CMAPs due to motor neuron loss, the pattern described is particularly suggestive of NMJ dysfunction. The negative edrophonium test is a point against *some* CMS, but variability exists, and the EMG finding is highly suggestive. Therefore, CMS is the most fitting diagnosis.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p01-002", "question": "A 35-year-old man is brought to the ED after being found agitated and confused.

Key findings include severe agitation, altered mental status (confusion), hyperthermia (39.2°C), autonomic instability (tachycardia 148 bpm, hypertension 182/108 mmHg), diaphoresis, neuromuscular hyperactivity (generalized hypertonia, intermittent purposeless limb movements), and rhabdomyolysis (CK 5,200 U/L). Vertical nystagmus is also present, which can be seen with certain intoxicants like phencyclidine (PCP).\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA.  Administer IV dantrolene and schedule cooled IV saline for suspected malignant hyperthermia: Malignant hyperthermia is typically triggered by anesthetic agents. While the patient has hyperthermia and rigidity, the history does not suggest anesthetic exposure. This is not the most likely diagnosis or appropriate initial treatment.\n\nB.  Rapid sequence intubation with succinylcholine and etomidate to allow active external cooling: Succinylcholine should be used with extreme caution in patients with rhabdomyolysis due to the risk of hyperkalemic cardiac arrest. Intubation is not immediately indicated unless there is respiratory failure or airway compromise, which is not described.\n\nC.  High-dose IV benzodiazepines and active cooling while avoiding physical restraints: Benzodiazepines are the first-line treatment for agitation, anxiety, muscle rigidity, and autonomic hyperactivity associated with stimulant and dissociative intoxications. They help reduce muscle activity and metabolic rate, which can ameliorate hyperthermia and prevent further rhabdomyolysis. Active cooling (e.g., ice packs, external fluid cooling) is crucial for severe hyperthermia. Avoiding physical restraints is important because they can increase stress, agitation, and muscle activity, worsening the patient's condition. This option addresses the most critical and immediate threats.\n\nD.  IV cyproheptadine and discontinuation of serotonergic medications for serotonin syndrome: Serotonin syndrome shares some features like agitation, hyperthermia, and autonomic instability. However, vertical nystagmus is less typical of serotonin syndrome compared to stimulant/dissociative intoxication. While serotonin syndrome is a possibility, the presentation leans more towards a sympathomimetic or dissociative toxidrome, for which benzodiazepines are the primary treatment.\n\nE.  Lorazepam and IV haloperidol for agitation control followed by CT head: Haloperidol, a typical antipsychotic, is generally contraindicated in acute stimulant or PCP intoxication because it can induce extrapyramidal symptoms, worsen hyperthermia, and cause QTc prolongation. Benzodiazepines are preferred for agitation in these cases. A CT head might be considered later if there are concerns for head injury or other neurological pathology, but immediate management of the acute toxic state takes priority.\n\nGiven the presentation, a stimulant or PCP toxidrome is highly suspected. High-dose IV benzodiazepines are the cornerstone of management for severe agitation and associated complications like hyperthermia and hypertonia in such cases. Active cooling is also vital.

Key elements supporting this diagnosis include:\n1.  Clinical Presentation: Fever, worsening lower abdominal pain, foul vaginal discharge, hypotension, and tachycardia indicate a severe systemic infection and shock.\n2.  Physical Exam: Diffuse lower abdominal guarding suggests peritonitis. Necrotic friable tissue with gas bubbles and crepitus at the posterior vaginal fornix extending toward the rectovaginal septum points to a rapidly spreading, gas-producing, necrotic infection in the pelvic and perineal tissues.\n3.  Laboratory Findings: Elevated WBC count (19,000/µL) indicates infection/inflammation. Elevated lactate (4.5 mmol/L) signifies tissue hypoperfusion and sepsis. Elevated creatinine (2.1 mg/dL) indicates acute kidney injury, likely secondary to sepsis.\n4.  Imaging (CT): Extensive gas along pelvic fascial planes into the perineum, and suspected uterine and vaginal wall necrosis, confirm the widespread nature of the infection and tissue devitalization. The absence of a discrete drainable collection implies a diffuse process rather than a simple abscess.\n5.  Risk Factors: Poorly controlled type 2 diabetes and prior pelvic radiation therapy can impair healing and predispose to severe infections and tissue necrosis.\n\nThis clinical picture is highly suggestive of a necrotizing infection, such as necrotizing fasciitis or gas gangrene, originating from or involving the pelvic organs and surrounding soft tissues. Such infections are life-threatening medical emergencies requiring immediate source control and aggressive management.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\nA.  Urgent total abdominal hysterectomy with wide radical debridement of necrotic pelvic and perineal tissue: This option offers definitive management by removing the presumed source of infection (uterus, if involved) and excising all devitalized, infected tissue. Aggressive surgical debridement is the cornerstone of treatment for necrotizing infections to control the spread of bacteria and toxins, and to allow for healing. Given the suspected uterine and vaginal necrosis and gas tracking into the perineum, this represents the most comprehensive and appropriate surgical intervention described.\n\nB.  Percutaneous CT-guided drainage of gas-containing pelvic spaces plus continued maximal antibiotics: The CT scan indicated no discrete drainable collection, and the gas was tracking along fascial planes. Percutaneous drainage is therefore unlikely to be effective for this diffuse process. Furthermore, drainage alone does not address necrotic tissue.\n\nC.  Hyperbaric oxygen therapy as a temporizing measure before any surgical intervention: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) can be adjunctive for specific anaerobic infections, but it is not a substitute for surgical source control and debridement, especially in a hemodynamically unstable patient with widespread necrosis. It is typically considered after initial surgical management has been established.\n\nD.  Emergent exploratory laparotomy limited to diagnostic assessment and peritoneal lavage: While laparotomy might be part of surgical management, limiting it to diagnostic assessment and peritoneal lavage would be insufficient given the clear evidence of suspected significant necrosis in the uterine and vaginal walls and perineum. Aggressive debridement of all necrotic tissue, whether intra-abdominal, pelvic, or perineal, is essential.\n\nE.  Conservative management with antibiotics and close ICU monitoring to avoid worsening radiation injury: This patient is experiencing septic shock (hypotension, tachycardia) from a life-threatening infection. Conservative management with antibiotics alone is inappropriate and will not address the critical need for source control and debridement of necrotic tissue.\n\nConsidering the severity of organ dysfunction (hypotension, AKI) and the extent of inferred tissue necrosis and gas production, option A is the most appropriate immediate next step as it directly addresses the source and extent of the infection with aggressive surgical management.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p01-004", "question": "A 54-year-old man with severe aortic stenosis and HFpEF is scheduled for open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.

This combination presents significant intraoperative challenges under general anesthesia.\n\nKey considerations for managing severe AS under general anesthesia include:\n1.  Maintaining adequate preload: Patients with AS are preload-dependent. Excessive diuresis or dehydration can lead to a critical drop in cardiac output.\n2.  Maintaining systemic vascular resistance (SVR): While very high SVR increases afterload and LV workload, profound vasodilation leading to hypotension is catastrophic. Reduced SVR can cause a sharp drop in blood pressure and coronary perfusion pressure, leading to myocardial ischemia and a collapse in cardiac output. Therefore, maintaining SVR in the normal to high-normal range is crucial to prevent this dangerous scenario. Vasopressors might be needed if anesthetics cause significant vasodilation.\n3.  Heart rate: Sinus rhythm is preferred. Bradycardia reduces cardiac output, as stroke volume is limited by the stenotic valve. Tachycardia can be beneficial for augmenting cardiac output, but it reduces diastolic filling time. In HFpEF, reduced diastolic filling time can increase LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and pulmonary congestion. Therefore, a normal to slightly elevated heart rate (e.g., 70-90 bpm) is often recommended, avoiding both extremes.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA.  Maintain a relatively high-normal systemic vascular resistance and sinus rhythm with slow-normal heart rate:\n    *   Maintaining high-normal SVR aims to prevent anesthetic-induced hypotension, which is critical for severe AS.\n    *   Sinus rhythm is ideal.\n    *   A slow-normal heart rate is suboptimal, as it can reduce cardiac output in AS. However, compared to other options, the SVR management principle is paramount.\n\nB.  Use vasodilatory anesthetic agents and permissive hypotension to reduce LV afterload:\n    *   Reducing LV afterload is beneficial for AS.\n    *   However, \"permissive hypotension\" is dangerous. Severe AS patients need adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP) for coronary perfusion (MAP - LVEDP). Allowing or inducing hypotension can lead to myocardial ischemia and hemodynamic collapse.\n\nC.  Allow mild tachycardia to augment cardiac output and reduce LV filling pressures:\n    *   Mild tachycardia can augment cardiac output.\n    *   However, in HFpEF with LVH, tachycardia reduces diastolic filling time, which can increase LVEDP and pulmonary congestion. This contradicts the goal of reducing LV filling pressures.\n\nD.  Aggressively diurese intraoperatively to avoid increases in LV end-diastolic volume:\n    *   Aggressive diuresis leads to hypovolemia and reduced preload. This is critically dangerous for patients with severe AS, who are preload-dependent for maintaining cardiac output.\n\nE.  Target low preload and low SVR with inodilators to optimize forward flow:\n    *   Low preload is dangerous for AS patients.\n    *   Low SVR, especially when combined with inodilators (which are potent vasodilators), can lead to severe hypotension and reduced cardiac output.\n\nConsidering the critical need to maintain hemodynamic stability in severe AS, especially preventing profound hypotension, option A addresses the most critical factor by emphasizing the maintenance of SVR. While the recommendation for heart rate is not ideal, the management of SVR is of utmost importance in this patient population with severe AS and a major surgical procedure under general anesthesia. The other options present more immediate and severe risks (hypotension, hypovolemia, or increased filling pressures).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p01-005", "question": "A 23-year-old man with treatment-resistant schizophrenia is receiving clozapine 350 mg/day.

Reduce clozapine to 50% of the current dose and monitor CBC weekly: This is also inappropriate. An ANC of 380/µL is too low to continue clozapine, even at a reduced dose. The drug must be stopped immediately.\n\nC.  Stop clozapine immediately and permanently discontinue it: Stopping clozapine immediately is correct for an ANC of 380/µL. \"Permanently discontinue\" is strongly supported by the guideline that reinitiation is \"generally not recommended\" for ANC < 500/µL. While this is a correct decision regarding clozapine, it doesn't explicitly state the plan for managing the patient's schizophrenia, for which clozapine was being used due to treatment resistance.\n\nD.  Switch from clozapine to another second-generation antipsychotic after ANC recovery: This option implies stopping clozapine (as one cannot switch from it without stopping), allowing the ANC to recover to a safe level, and then initiating treatment with a different second-generation antipsychotic. This acknowledges that the patient has treatment-resistant schizophrenia and requires ongoing antipsychotic treatment, and that clozapine is no longer a viable option due to the adverse event. This represents a comprehensive management plan for the patient's psychotropic regimen following the severe neutropenia. It implicitly means clozapine is not restarted, aligning with the general recommendation against reinitiation.\n\nComparing options C and D, option D provides a more complete management plan for the patient's psychotropic regimen. It addresses both the immediate necessity of discontinuing clozapine and provides a clear next step for managing the underlying treatment-resistant schizophrenia.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p01-006", "question": "A 63-year-old man is admitted with diffuse peritonitis due to perforated sigmoid diverticulitis.

His hemodynamics, respiratory status, metabolic parameters, and urine output have improved. Crucially, bowel edema has reduced, there is no ongoing contamination, and the fascial edges can be approximated under moderate tension. This indicates that the abdominal wall is now amenable to definitive closure.\n\nDamage-control laparotomy is a staged approach. The open abdomen is a temporary measure to manage compromised patients and improve physiological parameters. Once the patient is stabilized and the abdominal conditions improve (as described), the next step is usually definitive abdominal wall closure.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. Proceed with primary fascial closure at the next planned re-exploration: Given that the fascial edges can be approximated under moderate tension and the patient is stable, attempting primary fascial closure during the next surgical intervention is the most appropriate step. This aims to restore abdominal integrity and avoid complications associated with prolonged open abdomen or reliance on repair techniques for impossible direct closure.\n\nB. Defer fascial closure and continue open abdomen management until extubation is achieved: While open abdomen management is appropriate when fascial closure is not possible due to tension or edema, deferring closure solely until extubation when closure is now feasible is overly conservative and prolongs the risks associated with an open abdomen (e.g., fluid and heat loss, infection, fistula formation, prolonged stay).\n\nC. Place a permanent bridged synthetic mesh underlay to achieve abdominal closure at this operation: Synthetic mesh underlay is typically employed when primary fascial closure is impossible due to a large defect or significant loss of domain. The question states that fascial edges *can* be approximated under moderate tension, suggesting primary closure is a viable option, making mesh insertion unnecessary and potentially riskier in this setting, especially if there was any residual contamination.\n\nD. Perform component separation with biologic mesh reinforcement to achieve early definitive closure: Component separation is a technique to gain length for fascial closure when primary closure is not possible due to tension. Since the fascial edges can be approximated under *moderate* tension, component separation might be more invasive than necessary and primary closure should be attempted first. Biologic mesh has limitations and is often used in contaminated fields or when synthetic mesh is contraindicated.\n\nE. Convert to skin-only closure over the viscera (planned ventral hernia) and discontinue negative-pressure therapy: A planned ventral hernia is considered when fascial closure is impossible or carries an exceptionally high risk. In this patient, the conditions for closure have improved significantly, making a planned ventral hernia a suboptimal choice, as it sacrifices abdominal wall integrity unnecessarily.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate next step is to attempt primary fascial closure when the patient returns for the next stage of management.\n\nThe answer is A"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p01-007", "question": "A 32-year-old man presents with acute, painless decrease in vision in his right eye over 24 hours.

The patient has failed conservative management. The goal is to return to high-level pitching, which requires preserving range of motion, particularly external rotation, while restoring stability.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\nA. Open Bankart repair with capsular shift and biceps tenodesis: A Bankart lesion is typically anterior-inferior. While there is anterior-inferior capsular laxity, the primary labral pathology described is superior, extending posteriorly. An open approach is generally more invasive. A capsular shift can be aggressive and might restrict necessary external rotation for pitching.\nB. Arthroscopic SLAP repair with selective anteroinferior capsular plication: This option directly addresses both the identified pathologies. Arthroscopic SLAP repair aims to reattach the torn superior labrum and biceps anchor. Selective anteroinferior capsular plication targets the laxity in that region, providing stability without excessively limiting external rotation. This is a tailored approach for a throwing athlete with both labral pathology and capsular laxity.\nC. Isolated arthroscopic biceps tenodesis without labral repair: While the biceps is involved in a SLAP lesion, an isolated tenodesis would not address the underlying labral tear, which is the source of the mechanical symptoms and instability described.\nD. Arthroscopic debridement of the labral tear without repair or capsular work: Debridement is typically reserved for degenerative tears or when repair is not feasible in very elderly or low-demand patients. For a young, high-level athlete, preserving the labrum through repair is preferred to maximize function and prevent long-term degenerative changes.\nE. Latarjet coracoid transfer with capsular retensioning: This procedure is mainly indicated for frank anterior instability with significant glenoid bone loss, which is not described here. It is usually considered when other instability procedures have failed. It is also a more aggressive procedure that might limit range of motion.\n\nGiven the specific findings of a peel-back SLAP lesion and associated anterior-inferior capsular laxity in a throwing athlete, arthroscopic SLAP repair combined with targeted capsular plication to address the laxity is the most appropriate surgical strategy to restore stability and enable a return to high-level pitching.\n\nThe answer is B"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p01-009", "question": "A 54-year-old man with decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis (MELD-Na 29) is intubated for acute variceal hemorrhage and started on norepinephrine for hemorrhagic shock.

Despite fluid resuscitation, blood products, and initial vasopressor therapy (norepinephrine and vasopressin), the patient remains hypotensive with a MAP of 62 mm Hg, elevated lactate, and acidosis, indicating ongoing hypoperfusion. Echocardiographic findings of a hyperdynamic, small, underfilled left ventricle and collapsible IVC suggest significant intravascular volume depletion or severe systemic vasodilation. The high ScvO2 (76%) in the context of shock might indicate impaired oxygen utilization by tissues, severe shunting, or a hyperdynamic circulation response to profound vasodilation.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\nA. Add epinephrine infusion targeting higher MAP (70-75 mm Hg): A higher MAP target is appropriate for patients with cirrhosis and variceal bleeding to prevent re-bleeding. Epinephrine has both alpha and beta-adrenergic effects. Beta-1 effects could potentially improve contractility and cardiac output, which might be beneficial for an underfilled LV. However, epinephrine can cause significant splanchnic vasoconstriction, which is concerning in this patient with cirrhosis and variceal bleeding. It can also increase myocardial oxygen demand and risk of arrhythmias.\n\nB. Add low-dose dobutamine to improve splanchnic perfusion: Dobutamine is a vasodilator. Adding a vasodilator would likely further lower the MAP and could worsen the perfusion if the primary issue is hypotension and significant hypovolemia. While improving splanchnic perfusion is important, this is not the immediate priority when MAP is suboptimal and there is evidence of global hypoperfusion.\n\nC. Add angiotensin II infusion while maintaining current MAP target: Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor useful in refractory shock. However, the \"maintaining current MAP target\" of 62 mm Hg is likely insufficient. Escalating vasopressor therapy to achieve a higher MAP is indicated.\n\nD. Increase vasopressin above 0.04 units/min to exploit V1 receptor effect: Vasopressin is particularly useful in vasodilatory shock, including that associated with cirrhosis, as it binds to V1 receptors causing vasoconstriction. Increasing the dose of vasopressin is a logical step to further combat vasodilation and raise MAP. This approach is generally favored over catecholamines in cirrhotic patients because it is less likely to cause significant splanchnic vasoconstriction and has less impact on cardiac contractility and heart rate, which could be advantageous given the high ScvO2 and potential for adequate (or overdriven, given preload limitation) cardiac output. Higher doses of vasopressin are often used in refractory shock.\n\nE. Switch norepinephrine to phenylephrine to minimize beta-adrenergic effects: Phenylephrine is a pure alpha-1 agonist. While it increases SVR and MAP, it lacks the potential inotropic and chronotropic benefits of norepinephrine or epinephrine. Given the hyperdynamic LV, and the need to ensure adequate cardiac output, switching to phenylephrine might not be optimal. While beneficial in pure alpha-receptor mediated vasodilation, the patient has cirrhosis and likely mixed vasodilation/hypovolemia issues.\n\nConsidering the patient has cirrhosis and refractory vasodilatory shock, and exhibits a high ScvO2, increasing the dose of vasopressin to enhance V1 receptor-mediated vasoconstriction is the most appropriate next step.
