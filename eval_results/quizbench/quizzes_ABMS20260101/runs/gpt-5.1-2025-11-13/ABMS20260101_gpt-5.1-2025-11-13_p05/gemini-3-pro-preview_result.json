Imaging Features: The description of \"diffuse, sausage-shaped enlargement of the gland\" is the classic radiologic appearance of diffuse AIP. Furthermore, a \"capsule-like rim\" (a hypodense halo on CT) is a highly specific finding for AIP, thought to represent peripancreatic inflammation/fluid. While there is a dominant mass in the head causing obstruction, the background diffuse changes and the rim strongly favor AIP over pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.\n2.  Serology: The IgG4 level is elevated (180 mg/dL). While marked elevation (>2x ULN) is more specific, mild elevation supports the diagnosis in the setting of characteristic imaging. CA 19-9 is normal, which makes pancreatic cancer less likely (though does not rule it out).\n3.  Histology: EUS-FNA has been performed twice and was nondiagnostic. In the context of a pancreatic mass, negative biopsies for cancer, combined with features of AIP, should prompt consideration of a non-surgical diagnosis.\n4.  Demographics: A 39-year-old male fits the profile, although Type 1 AIP is often seen in older men (>60), it can occur in younger patients.\n\nManagement:\nAccording to the International Consensus Diagnostic Criteria (ICDC) for AIP, when imaging features are typical (diffuse enlargement with rim) or supported by collateral evidence (IgG4), and malignancy has been reasonably excluded (negative EUS-FNA), a diagnostic trial of corticosteroids is the appropriate management step. AIP is highly responsive to steroids. A repeat imaging study is usually performed after 2 weeks of therapy; a significant reduction in the size of the mass and resolution of the stricture confirms the diagnosis (and treats the patient).\n\n*   Option B: Pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) has significant morbidity and mortality. Given the strong evidence for a benign, treatable condition (AIP), proceeding directly to surgery without a steroid trial would lead to unnecessary organ resection.\n*   Option C: A third biopsy might be considered if the diagnosis were completely unclear, but flow cytometry targets lymphoma (rare). The clinical picture already strongly supports AIP, making the steroid trial high yield.\n*   Option D: Observation is unsafe due to the biliary obstruction and potential for disease progression or missed malignancy.\n*   Option E: Stenting treats the symptom but not the disease.

He is evaluated 3 weeks post-discharge after an acute exacerbation requiring noninvasive ventilation (NIV).\n\nThe most appropriate next step is Option B: Start nocturnal noninvasive ventilation with targeted normalization of PaCO2.\n\nHere is the rationale:\n1.  Indication: Guidelines and clinical trials support the use of long-term home NIV for stable hypercapnic COPD patients with severe hypercapnia (PaCO2 >50–52 mm Hg) and specifically for those with persistent hypercapnia 2–4 weeks following an acute exacerbation.\n2.  Evidence for Mortality Benefit: The landmark study by Köhnlein et al. (2014) demonstrated that \"high-intensity\" NIV (targeting a reduction in PaCO2 to normal or by at least 20%) significantly improved 1-year survival in patients with stable hypercapnic COPD compared to standard care. Additionally, the HOT-HMV trial (Murphy et al., 2017) showed that home NIV combined with oxygen therapy improved admission-free survival in patients with persistent hypercapnia after an acute exacerbation.\n3.  Symptom Relief: The patient's symptoms (morning headaches, somnolence) are classic for nocturnal hypoventilation leading to CO2 retention. NIV assists ventilation, rests respiratory muscles, and corrects these symptoms.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n*   A: Increasing oxygen to maintain PaO2 >80 mm Hg is dangerous in chronic hypercapnia. It can worsen CO2 retention due to the Haldane effect and V/Q mismatch. The patient's PaO2 is already adequate (>60 mm Hg).\n*   C: Chronic systemic corticosteroids are associated with significant morbidity (osteoporosis, myopathy, metabolic issues) and increased mortality in COPD; they are not indicated for maintenance.\n*   D: Acetazolamide is a respiratory stimulant but does not provide ventilatory support to offload fatigued muscles. It has not been shown to improve mortality in this setting to the same extent as NIV.\n*   E: While High-Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) is being studied, the evidence for mortality benefit in chronic hypercapnic COPD is currently stronger for NIV, particularly strategies targeting PaCO2 reduction.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p05", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p05-003", "question": "A 55-year-old man from a region endemic for Lyme disease presents with 1 week of rapidly progressive bilateral leg weakness and numbness ascending from the feet, severe radicular pain, and new urinary retention.

The standard induction therapy for a first episode of SSNS involves daily high-dose prednisone. While protocols vary (e.g., KDIGO 2021 recommends 4 weeks daily; older/more intensive protocols like the German APN recommend 6 weeks daily), a minimum of 4 weeks of daily therapy is universally recommended to induce stable remission and minimize the risk of relapse. Shortening the daily phase is strongly associated with an increased risk of relapse.\n\nThis patient is at week 3 of treatment. Although she is in remission (proteinuria resolved, normal albumin), the induction course is not complete.\n\nShe has developed hypertension (Stage 2), which is a common side effect of high-dose corticosteroids. However, she is asymptomatic (no headache, visual changes, or heart failure) and has normal renal function and normal albumin (indicating restoration of intravascular volume).\n\nAnalysis of Options:\n\n*   A. Initiate an ACE inhibitor and maintain the current steroid dose until 6 weeks are completed: This is the most appropriate management.\n    *   Steroid Management: Completing the daily course (here specified as 6 weeks, consistent with the APN protocol which showed lower relapse rates than shorter courses) is crucial to prevent relapse.\n    *   Hypertension Management: The hypertension needs to be treated. ACE inhibitors (and ARBs) are preferred first-line antihypertensive agents in children with kidney disease and proteinuria/history of proteinuria, provided there are no contraindications like hypovolemia or hyperkalemia. This patient has normal albumin (normovolemia) and normal electrolytes, making an ACE inhibitor a safe and standard choice to control blood pressure while providing renoprotection.\n*   B. Switch from daily to alternate-day prednisone dosing immediately and start a calcium channel blocker: Switching to alternate-dose prednisone at only 3 weeks is premature and significantly increases the risk of relapse. While CCBs are effective for steroid-induced hypertension, the alteration of the steroid regimen makes this option incorrect.\n*   C. Begin a low-dose thiazide diuretic while continuing full-dose prednisone and sodium restriction: While sodium restriction is correct and diuretics can address steroid-induced salt retention, a \"low-dose\" thiazide is likely insufficient for Grade 2 hypertension (98th/99th percentile). Furthermore, ACE inhibitors are generally preferred in the context of renal pathology. Option A provides a more specific and guideline-congruent plan regarding the steroid duration.\n*   D. Add tacrolimus and rapidly taper prednisone...: Tacrolimus is a second-line agent for steroid-dependent or steroid-resistant cases, not for a first episode of SSNS with manageable side effects. Rapid tapering is dangerous.\n*   E. Discontinue prednisone abruptly...: This is dangerous due to the risk of adrenal crisis and will likely precipitate a relapse of the nephrotic syndrome.\n\nTherefore, the best course of action is to treat the hypertension pharmacologically while finishing the standard course of daily steroids to ensure durable remission.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p05", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p05-005", "question": "A 28-year-old man is brought to the ED after a high-speed MVC with hypotension and abdominal distension.

Choice of Reperfusion: The primary options are systemic thrombolysis, catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT), or surgical embolectomy.\n    *   Systemic Thrombolysis (Option A): This is the generally recommended first-line treatment for massive PE with hemodynamic instability in pregnant patients, provided there are no absolute contraindications to thrombolysis (which the prompt states this patient does not have). Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (alteplase) does not cross the placenta due to its large molecular size (~72 kDa), minimizing direct teratogenic risk or fetal hemorrhage, although the risk of placental abruption or maternal hemorrhage exists. However, maternal survival is the priority, and systemic lysis is the most rapidly administerable therapy in the ED.\n    *   Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis (Option B): While CDT uses a lower dose of lytic and theoretically reduces bleeding risk, it requires mobilization of an interventional team and transport to a cath lab. In a patient with frank shock (hypotension and near syncope), the delay inherent in arranging CDT is often unacceptable compared to immediate systemic administration in the resuscitation bay.\n    *   Surgical Embolectomy (Option C): This requires cardiopulmonary bypass, which carries significant risks of fetal mortality (though improved in recent years) and maternal morbidity. It is typically reserved for cases where thrombolysis is contraindicated or has failed, or in centers with immediate surgical availability and specific expertise.\n    *   Tenecteplase (Option E): While used in some protocols and trials (e.g., for intermediate-risk PE), Alteplase is the FDA-approved and most widely cited agent for massive PE in guideline recommendations.\n\nTherefore, immediate systemic thrombolysis with alteplase is the most appropriate management for maximizing maternal survival in this unstable patient.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p05", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p05-007", "question": "A 28-year-old woman presents with recurrent episodes of suddenly \"losing time\" for several hours, during which she is observed by coworkers to function at her high-stress job but later has no recollection of events.

The primary goals are establishing confirmed safety, therapeutic alliance, and stabilization of symptoms.

Initiate IV unfractionated heparin infusion: Guidelines recommend against the administration of full-dose anticoagulation (like heparin) within the first 24 hours after IV thrombolysis due to the significantly increased risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. While the patient has a low EF and risks are high, the bleeding risk with concurrent IVT and heparin is prohibitive.\n*   B. Administer IV labetalol to reduce blood pressure to <140/90 mm Hg: For patients receiving IV thrombolysis, the blood pressure goal is <185/110 mm Hg prior to bolus and <180/105 mm Hg for the first 24 hours. Aggressively lowering BP to <140/90 mm Hg in the acute phase of an ischemic stroke—especially with an LVO dependent on collateral flow—can compromise cerebral perfusion pressure and extend the infarct size.\n*   C. Start high-dose statin and delay any antiplatelet therapy until 24 hours after thrombolysis: This is the correct management. Current guidelines (AHA/ASA) recommend initiating high-intensity statin therapy early in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Crucially, guidelines also mandate that antiplatelet agents (aspirin, clopidogrel) and anticoagulants generally be withheld for 24 hours following the administration of IV thrombolytics to minimize the risk of hemorrhagic transformation. A follow-up scan (CT or MRI) is typically performed at 24 hours to rule out hemorrhage before starting these agents.\n*   D. Begin dual antiplatelet therapy immediately: Similar to option A, administering antiplatelets immediately after IV thrombolysis increases the risk of bleeding and is generally contraindicated until the 24-hour post-treatment window has passed and hemorrhage has been excluded.\n*   E.

Medical Management: The immediate priority is to control blood pressure and prevent hypertensive crisis during eventual surgery. The correct pharmacological sequence is to initiate alpha-adrenergic blockade (e.g., phenoxybenzamine, doxazosin) first to induce vasodilation. Once alpha-blockade is established, beta-blockade can be added to control tachycardia. Giving beta-blockers *before* alpha-blockers (Option C) is contraindicated because unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation can precipitate a hypertensive crisis and heart failure.\n\n2.  Surgical Management: Since the patient has bilateral adrenal masses, a total bilateral adrenalectomy (Option B) would render the patient permanently dependent on glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement, carrying a risk of life-threatening adrenal crisis (Addisonian crisis) if medication is missed or during stress. In pediatric patients and those with hereditary bilateral pheochromocytomas (associated with MEN2, VHL, and NF1), cortical-sparing (partial) adrenalectomy is the preferred surgical approach. This technique aims to remove the catecholamine-secreting tumor while preserving enough functional adrenal cortex to maintain endogenous steroid production, thereby avoiding lifelong replacement therapy. Given the relatively small size of the tumors (2.5 cm and 1.2 cm), cortical-sparing surgery is feasible and appropriate. Unilateral surgery (Option A) would leave a functional tumor in place. Observation (Option E) is dangerous as these tumors do not regress and pose significant cardiovascular risk.\n\nTherefore, the correct management is to stabilize the patient with alpha-blockade followed by beta-blockade, then proceed with cortical-sparing adrenal surgery.\n\nThe answer is (D)"}]
