These findings are highly suggestive of IgG4-related autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP).\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Trial of high-dose corticosteroids with close radiologic follow-up before considering surgery: This is the standard approach for suspected AIP, especially when biopsies are inconclusive but imaging is characteristic. Autoimmune pancreatitis typically responds well to corticosteroids. If the lesion shrinks and symptoms improve, it strongly supports the diagnosis of AIP and avoids potentially unnecessary surgery.\n\nB. Pancreaticoduodenectomy because focal autoimmune pancreatitis cannot be reliably distinguished from adenocarcinoma: While it can be challenging to differentiate, the combination of elevated IgG4, characteristic CT imaging, and normal CA 19-9 makes AIP much more likely than adenocarcinoma in this case. Surgical resection is usually reserved for cases where AIP is uncertain, there is a lack of response to medical therapy, or malignancy is highly suspected and confirmed.\n\nC. Repeat EUS-FNA with core needle and flow cytometry to exclude lymphoma: While lymphoma is a differential diagnosis for a pancreatic mass, the imaging features and elevated IgG4 point away from lymphoma and towards AIP. Advanced biopsy techniques are not the most appropriate *initial* step when AIP is strongly suspected and has a specific, non-surgical treatment.\n\nD. Observation alone with serial imaging in 6 months given low CA 19-9 and mild symptoms: The patient has recurrent pancreatitis, which is not considered mild. The mass causing biliary obstruction requires active management, not observation alone, to prevent further complications and symptoms.\n\nE. ERCP with biliary brushing cytology and stent placement, with surgery only if cytology is positive: ERCP is useful for luminal pathology or biliary decompression. While biliary brushing might yield some diagnostic information, it focuses on the duct rather than the solid pancreatic mass itself. It does not directly address the underlying cause of the mass (suspected AIP) and is not the primary diagnostic or therapeutic approach for AIP. Stent placement might be needed for symptoms, but is not the first step for diagnosing and managing suspected AIP.\n\nGiven the strong suspicion for IgG4-related AIP based on the clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings, a trial of corticosteroids is the most appropriate management approach.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p05", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p05-002", "question": "A 72-year-old man with long-standing COPD (FEV1 35% predicted), chronic hypercapnia, and recent admission for an acute exacerbation requiring noninvasive ventilation is evaluated 3 weeks after discharge.

Recent acute exacerbation requiring noninvasive ventilation (NIV) demonstrates his vulnerability and the need for ventilatory support. Overnight oximetry confirms sustained hypoventilation, which is contributing to episodic desaturations. Despite adherence to optimal medical therapy and pulmonary rehabilitation, his chronic hypercapnia persists.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Increase long-term oxygen therapy to maintain PaO2 >80 mm Hg: While adequate oxygenation is important, the patient's current PaO2 of 70 mm Hg is acceptable. Increasing oxygen alone without addressing the underlying hypoventilation may worsen hypercapnia by suppressing respiratory drive, especially in patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure. This option does not target the root cause of his symptoms.\n\nB. Start nocturnal noninvasive ventilation with targeted normalization of PaCO2: Nocturnal NIV is indicated for patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure due to COPD who experience persistent symptoms or hypoventilation, particularly if they have had an exacerbation requiring NIV. NIV directly counteracts hypoventilation, reduces the work of breathing, improves gas exchange (lowering PaCO2), alleviates symptoms of hypercapnia, and has been shown to improve outcomes, including mortality, in selected patients. The patient's findings of chronic hypercapnia, hypoventilation, and symptoms of hypercapnia strongly suggest this is the most appropriate intervention.\n\nC. Add chronic low-dose oral prednisone: Oral corticosteroids are typically reserved for managing acute exacerbations of COPD or severe, poorly controlled asthma. Chronic use of oral steroids is associated with significant side effects and is not indicated for the management of stable, compensated chronic hypercapnia and hypoventilation.\n\nD. Begin acetazolamide at night to stimulate ventilation: Acetazolamide can theoretically increase respiratory drive by causing a metabolic acidosis. However, it is not a first-line treatment for chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure in COPD. Its efficacy is limited compared to ventilatory support, and it carries a risk of side effects like electrolyte disturbances and worsening metabolic acidosis.\n\nE. Switch to high-flow nasal cannula at home during sleep: High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) can deliver heated, humidified oxygen and provide some positive pressure, aiding in oxygenation and comfort. However, it is generally less effective than NIV in providing significant ventilatory support to overcome profound hypoventilation and correct chronic hypercapnia in severe COPD. NIV actively assists ventilation, which is precisely what this patient's condition requires.\n\nConsidering the patient's chronic hypercapnia, hypoventilation, and symptoms, nocturnal NIV is the most evidence-based and effective strategy to improve his long-term outcomes and mortality.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p05", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p05-003", "question": "A 55-year-old man from a region endemic for Lyme disease presents with 1 week of rapidly progressive bilateral leg weakness and numbness ascending from the feet, severe radicular pain, and new urinary retention.

His neurological examination reveals motor weakness, hyperreflexia, Babinski signs (indicating upper motor neuron involvement), and a sensory level, localized to the thoracic cord. His history of recent erythema migrans followed by a hiking trip in an endemic region, along with negative tests for HIV, syphilis, and TB, strongly points towards Lyme disease as the etiology.\n\nThe MRI shows multifocal enhancing lesions in the thoracic cord with leptomeningeal enhancement, confirming inflammatory myelitis and leptomeningitis, not due to compression. The CSF analysis reveals lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and importantly, an elevated CSF Lyme antibody index, definitively diagnosing neuroborreliosis. The presence of intrathecal antibody production (oligoclonal bands) is also typical.\n\nThe treatment for neuroborreliosis involving the central nervous system, especially severe forms like myelitis, requires intravenous antibiotics. Ceftriaxone is a highly effective intravenous antibiotic for neuroborreliosis. However, given the severity of the neurological deficit (rapidly progressive weakness, Babinski signs, urinary retention) and significant inflammation demonstrated by MRI and CSF, a concurrent immunosuppressive therapy to reduce inflammation and edema is often indicated. High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone is the standard for this purpose.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\n*   A. High-dose IV methylprednisolone alone for presumed idiopathic transverse myelitis: This is incorrect because the cause is identified as Lyme disease, not idiopathic. Treating an infectious cause of myelitis with steroids alone without antibiotics would be detrimental.\n*   B. IV ceftriaxone 2 g daily for 4 weeks without steroids: While IV ceftriaxone is appropriate, for severe neuroborreliosis with significant myelitis, steroid co-administration is often beneficial to mitigate inflammation and potential irreversible neurological damage.\n*   C. IV ceftriaxone 2 g daily plus high-dose IV methylprednisolone: This option addresses both the infectious cause (ceftriaxone) and the severe inflammatory component of the myelitis (methylprednisolone). This combination is considered the most appropriate management for severe neuroborreliosis involving significant spinal cord inflammation.\n*   D. Oral doxycycline 100 mg BID for 28 days plus high-dose oral prednisone taper: Oral doxycycline is generally considered suboptimal for neuroborreliosis, especially severe CNS involvement. Intravenous therapy is preferred. Oral prednisone is also less potent and slower-acting than IV methylprednisolone for acute, severe CNS inflammation.\n*   E. Plasma exchange for 5-7 sessions followed by IV ceftriaxone: Plasma exchange is not a standard first-line treatment for infectious myelitis, including neuroborreliosis. It is typically reserved for specific autoimmune conditions or severe cases unresponsive to standard treatments.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate treatment for this patient with severe neuroborreliosis manifesting as myelitis is the combination of intravenous antibiotics and high-dose intravenous steroids.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p05", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p05-004", "question": "A 4-year-old girl with newly diagnosed steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome starts high-dose prednisone 2 mg/kg/day.

She has developed significant hypertension (98th percentile systolic, 99th percentile diastolic). Baseline renal function and electrolytes are normal, and she is asymptomatic.\n\nThe hypertension is likely a steroid-induced side effect. Standard treatment for a first episode of steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome involves daily high-dose prednisone for 4-6 weeks to induce remission. Since the patient has only been on prednisone for 3 weeks, she is still within the typical induction period. Prematurely altering the steroid regimen could risk a relapse of the nephrotic syndrome. Therefore, the most appropriate approach is to manage the hypertension while continuing the prescribed steroid regimen for the recommended duration.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. Initiate an ACE inhibitor and maintain the current steroid dose until 6 weeks are completed.\nACE inhibitors are first-line agents for hypertension in children, especially those with renal disease or proteinuric conditions, as they are effective and may offer renoprotective benefits. Maintaining the current steroid dose is appropriate as the induction phase for nephrotic syndrome is typically 4-6 weeks, and she is only at 3 weeks. This option addresses both the current hypertension and the ongoing management of nephrotic syndrome.\n\nB. Switch from daily to alternate-day prednisone dosing immediately and start a calcium channel blocker.\nSwitching to alternate-day prednisone is usually done during the tapering phase after remission is well-established, not immediately upon achieving remission, especially if significant side effects like hypertension are present. This could lead to a relapse. Calcium channel blockers are appropriate antihypertensives, but the steroid management is questionable.\n\nC. Begin a low-dose thiazide diuretic while continuing full-dose prednisone and sodium restriction.\nSodium restriction is an important non-pharmacological measure for managing hypertension in nephrotic syndrome. Thiazide diuretics can also be effective. However, ACE inhibitors or ARBs are generally preferred as first-line antihypertensive agents in children with renal disease due to their efficacy and potential for renoprotection. While this is a reasonable approach, an ACE inhibitor might be considered more optimal.\n\nD. Add tacrolimus and rapidly taper prednisone over 5 days while observing blood pressure.\nTacrolimus is an immunosuppressant used in steroid-resistant or frequent relapsing nephrotic syndrome, not typically for managing steroid-induced hypertension in a case of steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome. Rapidly tapering prednisone is inappropriate as it can lead to relapse of nephrotic syndrome and potential adrenal insufficiency.\n\nE. Discontinue prednisone abruptly and monitor for adrenal insufficiency while starting an ARB.\nAbruptly discontinuing prednisone after 3 weeks of high-dose therapy is dangerous due to the risk of HPA axis suppression and adrenal insufficiency. ARBs are appropriate antihypertensives, but the abrupt steroid discontinuation is a critical flaw.\n\nComparing the options, option A provides the most appropriate management for both the hypertension and the underlying nephrotic syndrome. It advocates for treating the hypertension with a standard first-line medication while allowing the essential induction therapy for nephrotic syndrome to continue for its recommended duration.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p05", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p05-005", "question": "A 28-year-old man is brought to the ED after a high-speed MVC with hypotension and abdominal distension.

Several physiological derangements are identified that significantly impair hemostasis:\n1.  Hypothermia: Core temperature of 33.5°C. Hypothermia impairs platelet function and the activity of multiple clotting factors.\n2.  Acidosis: pH of 7.09. Acidosis also interferes with platelet function and the coagulation cascade, and can reduce the effectiveness of blood products.\n3.  Hypocalcemia: Ionized calcium of 0.9 mmol/L (normal 1.0-1.3 mmol/L). Calcium is a critical cofactor for many steps in the coagulation cascade. Citrate-anticoagulated blood products can chelate calcium, and hypothermia and acidosis also affect ionized calcium levels.\n4.  Coagulopathy: INR of 2.4 indicates impaired prothrombin time, suggestive of deficiency in or dysfunction of coagulation factors, likely due to consumption, dilution, and impaired synthesis.\n5.  Ongoing Hemorrhage: Oozing from surgical drains despite massive transfusion (6 PRBC, 6 FFP, 1 platelet unit) indicates that the bleeding is not controlled, and the patient continues to lose blood and clotting components.\n\nThe \"lethal triad\" of trauma and resuscitation is hypothermia, acidosis, and coagulopathy.

Initiate aggressive rewarming, calcium replacement, and correction of acidosis before further factor therapy: This option directly addresses the most critical reversible factors impairing coagulation.

The bedside echocardiogram findings of a dilated right ventricle (RV) with McConnell sign and septal flattening further support right ventricular strain due to massive PE. The patient is hemodynamically unstable (BP 82/48 mmHg), classifying this as a massive PE requiring immediate reperfusion therapy. In such critical situations, definitive imaging (CTA) can be forgone if clinical suspicion is high and the patient is unstable.\n\nThe management options need to be evaluated for appropriateness and timeliness.\n\nA. Systemic thrombolysis with weight-based alteplase bolus and infusion: This is a standard and effective treatment for massive PE. However, initiating an infusion can take time.\n\nB. Urgent catheter-directed thrombolysis with reduced-dose alteplase: This is a less invasive alternative to surgery and can be considered when systemic thrombolysis is relatively contraindicated or fails. However, it is typically slower to initiate than systemic thrombolysis and requires specialized resources. It is not generally the first choice for immediate management in a patient who is consentable for systemic thrombolysis.\n\nC. Immediate transfer for surgical embolectomy with cardiopulmonary bypass: Surgical embolectomy is reserved for patients with absolute contraindications to thrombolysis or when thrombolysis fails. Transferring an unstable patient for surgery adds significant delay and risks and is usually not the first step.\n\nD. Initiate high-dose unfractionated heparin and defer reperfusion until postpartum: Heparin is an anticoagulant, not a reperfusion agent. For a massive PE causing shock, anticoagulation alone is insufficient; reperfusion is necessary to relieve the obstruction and RV strain. Delaying reperfusion would be life-threatening.\n\nE. Administer tenecteplase as a single IV bolus followed by heparin: Tenecteplase is a fibrin-specific thrombolytic agent that is administered as a single IV bolus. This makes it very rapid and simple to administer, which is a significant advantage in a critically ill, hemodynamically unstable patient where time to reperfusion is crucial for survival. Following thrombolysis, anticoagulation with heparin is initiated. Tenecteplase is a well-established and often preferred agent for systemic thrombolysis in acute massive PE due to its favorable administration profile.\n\nGiven the patient's hemodynamic instability and the need for rapid intervention, systemic thrombolysis is the most appropriate strategy. Between options A and E, tenecteplase administered as a single bolus (E) is generally faster and easier to administer in an emergency setting compared to an alteplase bolus and infusion (A).

She views the dissociative episodes as an \"escape\" from overwhelming emotions. Neurological workup and substance use screening are negative. This presentation is highly suggestive of a dissociative disorder, likely developed in response to chronic early trauma where dissociation served as a coping mechanism.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. High-frequency supportive psychodynamic psychotherapy focused on strengthening defenses and minimizing exploration of trauma content: While supportive psychotherapy can be part of treatment, the goal is typically not to *strengthen* defenses (like dissociation) but to understand and process the underlying issues. Minimizing trauma exploration would be counterproductive in treating a disorder rooted in trauma.\n\nB. Trauma-focused exposure therapy directly targeting the amnestic episodes with in vivo and imaginal exposure: This approach, like standard exposure therapy for PTSD, might be too destabilizing for a patient with significant dissociative symptoms and limited affect regulation skills. The primary goal in early stages of treating dissociative disorders is often stabilization, not direct confrontation with traumatic memories or dissociative experiences that could worsen decompensation.\n\nC. Phase-oriented trauma therapy emphasizing stabilization, skills for affect regulation, and gradual integration of dissociative states: This is the current gold standard for treating complex trauma and dissociative disorders. It involves distinct phases:\n1.  Stabilization: Establishing safety, developing coping skills for emotional regulation and distress tolerance, building a therapeutic alliance, and symptom management. This is critical for patients experiencing episodes of amnesia and depersonalization as an \"escape.\"\n2.  Trauma Processing: Gradually processing traumatic memories and their impact.\n3.  Integration/Rehabilitation: Integrating dissociated aspects of the self and functioning in daily life.\nGiven the patient's symptoms, the need for an \"escape\" from emotions, and the distress, stabilization and skills for affect regulation are paramount before proceeding deeply into trauma processing.\n\nD. Manualized cognitive processing therapy focusing on cognitive restructuring of maladaptive trauma-related beliefs without addressing dissociation: Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) is effective for PTSD, but it requires a certain level of cognitive stability and the ability to engage with trauma narratives. It is generally not the first-line treatment for complex dissociative disorders, especially when dissociation itself is a prominent symptom that needs to be addressed directly. This option explicitly excludes addressing dissociation.\n\nE. Hypnotic age-regression therapy aimed at recovering repressed memories of early childhood to reduce dissociative barriers: While hypnosis can be a useful technique *within* trauma therapy for dissociative disorders, using age-regression as the primary strategy without prior stabilization can be risky. It can lead to the creation of confabulated memories or destabilize the patient if not carefully managed, and memory recovery is usually a later component of treatment, not the initial focus.\n\nTherefore, phase-oriented trauma therapy is the most appropriate primary strategy.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p05", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p05-008", "question": "A 63-year-old man with long-standing hypertension and ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 30%) presents with acute right hemiplegia and aphasia 45 minutes after symptom onset.

Several factors are critical in managing such patients:\n\n1.  Blood Pressure Management: For IV thrombolysis (tissue plasminogen activator, tPA), blood pressure must be controlled. Specifically, SBP should be <185 mmHg and DBP <110 mmHg before administration. If the blood pressure is elevated, it needs to be lowered. Long-standing hypertension in an acute stroke patient makes elevated blood pressure highly probable and a key factor to manage for safe and effective thrombolysis. Labetalol is an appropriate IV agent for blood pressure reduction. While the target of <140/90 mmHg might be considered quite strict for the pre-thrombolysis target (the immediate threshold is <185/110 mmHg), the principle of actively managing hypertension before thrombolysis is paramount and the most appropriate acute action among the choices.\n\n2.  Anticoagulation/Antiplatelets:\n    *   Option A suggests initiating IV unfractionated heparin *before* mechanical thrombectomy. Heparin is generally not recommended *before* IV thrombolysis due to increased risk of hemorrhagic transformation. Anticoagulation is typically considered later in management, after successful reperfusion and exclusion of hemorrhage, or for specific indications.\n    *   Option D suggests starting dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) *immediately after* thrombolysis. Immediate DAPT is generally not indicated and may increase bleeding risk. DAPT is often considered within 24 hours after successful reperfusion, but not immediately.\n    *   Option C suggests delaying antiplatelet therapy until 24 hours after thrombolysis, which is a common strategy, and starting a high-dose statin. Starting statins is important for secondary prevention, usually within 24-48 hours, but BP management is a more immediate acute intervention critical for the safety of the planned procedures.\n\n3.  Cardiac Status: Frequent PVCs and mild elevation in troponin with flat serial testing suggest potential underlying cardiac issues or demand ischemia, which could raise suspicion for a cardioembolic source. However, as noted above, initiating heparin before reperfusion procedures is not standard practice.\n\n4.

These include short stature, sensorineural hearing loss, ptosis, fatigue, exercise intolerance, and a maternal family history of early-onset diabetes and deafness. The elevated random glucose and HbA1c confirm hyperglycemia. The negative autoantibodies make autoimmune diabetes (Type 1) less likely, and the syndromic features are not typical of Type 2 diabetes, especially without obesity. The presence of elevated lactate that worsens with exercise is consistent with mitochondrial dysfunction.\n\nMIDD is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA that impair mitochondrial function, leading to progressive beta-cell dysfunction (and thus diabetes) and other systemic symptoms. While some patients with MIDD may initially be managed with oral agents, insulin therapy is often required for long-term glycemic control as beta-cell function declines.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA.  High-dose metformin monotherapy: Metformin is typically used for Type 2 diabetes. While it is sometimes used cautiously in mitochondrial disorders, it is not usually the first-line treatment for significant hyperglycemia (HbA1c 8.1%) in a young patient with suspected monogenic/mitochondrial diabetes. It carries a theoretical risk of lactic acidosis, especially in conditions with mitochondrial dysfunction, although this is rare.\nB.  Immediate initiation of a basal-bolus insulin regimen: With an HbA1c of 8.1% and significant symptoms like fatigue and exercise intolerance, insulin therapy is often the most effective and safest way to achieve rapid glycemic control and potentially alleviate symptoms. Insulin bypasses the failing beta cells and provides exogenous insulin to manage hyperglycemia. For significant hyperglycemia and symptomatic patients, especially in a progressive condition like MIDD, insulin is a common and appropriate initial treatment.\nC.  Sulfonylurea monotherapy due to likely KATP channel mutation: Sulfonylureas are effective for certain types of monogenic diabetes (MODY) caused by mutations in KATP channel genes. However, MIDD is a mitochondrial disorder, not caused by nuclear gene defects affecting KATP channels. Therefore, the rationale provided is incorrect, and sulfonylureas are not the preferred first-line agent for MIDD.\nD.  GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy to improve insulin secretion: GLP-1 receptor agonists are primarily used for Type 2 diabetes. While they can enhance glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, they are not typically considered first-line for suspected MIDD with significant hyperglycemia.\nE.  SGLT2 inhibitor added to lifestyle therapy to decrease renal glucose reabsorption: SGLT2 inhibitors are also primarily used for Type 2 diabetes and are generally used in adults. They are not typically first-line for monogenic or mitochondrial diabetes, especially in this age group.\n\nConsidering the patient's significant hyperglycemia (HbA1c 8.1%) and symptomatic presentation, along with the likely diagnosis of MIDD, immediate initiation of a basal-bolus insulin regimen is the most appropriate choice for achieving optimal glycemic control and improving her quality of life.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p05", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p05-010", "question": "A 9-year-old boy presents with recurrent episodes of facial flushing, headache, tachycardia, and severe hypertension.

Elevated plasma free metanephrines confirm the diagnosis, and imaging shows bilateral adrenal masses.\n\nManagement of pheochromocytoma requires meticulous preparation before surgical resection. The critical steps are:\n1.  Medical stabilization: This involves controlling the excessive catecholamine release from the tumor.\n    *   Alpha-adrenergic blockade must be initiated FIRST. This is crucial to prevent a hypertensive crisis during manipulation of the tumor or surgery. Agents like phenoxybenzamine or selective alpha-1 blockers are used. Patients typically require 7-14 days of alpha-blockade to achieve adequate control and volume expansion.\n    *   Beta-adrenergic blockade is added AFTER adequate alpha-blockade has been achieved. Beta-blockers help control tachycardia, palpitations, and arrhythmias, but initiating them before alpha-blockade can lead to unopposed alpha-stimulation and severe hypertension.\n2.

Initiate alpha-adrenergic blockade followed by beta-blockade and plan for cortical-sparing adrenal surgery. This option correctly outlines the sequence of medical management (alpha-blockade before beta-blockade) and proposes a surgical strategy (cortical-sparing surgery) that is most appropriate for bilateral pheochromocytomas, especially in the context of NF1, where preserving adrenal function is highly desirable if technically feasible and oncologically safe. This approach aims to remove the tumor(s) while leaving functional adrenal tissue.\nE. Observe with annual imaging because most pediatric pheochromocytomas regress spontaneously. This is false.
