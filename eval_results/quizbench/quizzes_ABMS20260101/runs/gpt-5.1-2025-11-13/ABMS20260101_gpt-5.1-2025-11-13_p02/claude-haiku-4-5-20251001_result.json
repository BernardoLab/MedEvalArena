Baseline ILD risk: This patient has severely compromised pulmonary function. UIP pattern ILD with DLCO 35% predicted represents advanced disease with high baseline risk for acute exacerbation and fatal pneumonitis.\n\n2. Radiation pneumonitis pathophysiology: In patients with pre-existing ILD, the risk of fatal radiation pneumonitis is driven primarily by:\n   - Mean lung dose (MLD) - most predictive of pneumonitis risk\n   - V20 (volume receiving ≥20 Gy) - also highly predictive\n   - The combination of chemotherapy (carboplatin/paclitaxel) adds additional pulmonary toxicity risk\n\n3. Analysis of options:\n\n   A. MLD <10 Gy, accepting higher heart V40: MLD is the single most important predictor of radiation pneumonitis. In patients with baseline ILD, keeping MLD very low is critical. This prioritizes the organ at highest risk of fatal toxicity.\n\n   B. V20 <20%, accepting MLD up to 15 Gy: V20 is important, but allowing MLD to reach 15 Gy in a patient with severe baseline ILD is too permissive and increases pneumonitis risk significantly.\n\n   C. Ipsilateral lung V30 <15%: This is too narrow and doesn't address the full lung dose distribution adequately.\n\n   D. V5 <40%: V5 is less predictive of pneumonitis than MLD or V20; this prioritizes the wrong metric.\n\n   E. Heart V30 <30%: This deprioritizes lung protection, which is inappropriate given the severe baseline ILD.\n\nRationale for A: In a patient with severe baseline ILD and DLCO 35% predicted, the absolute priority must be minimizing the risk of fatal radiation pneumonitis. MLD <10 Gy is the most critical constraint. While accepting a modest increase in heart V40 is not ideal, the risk of fatal pneumonitis from inadequate lung protection far outweighs the risk of cardiac toxicity in this scenario. The heart can tolerate V40 up to 40-50% without prohibitive risk, whereas this patient's lungs cannot tolerate high doses given baseline compromise.\n\nThe answer is A"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p02", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p02-008", "question": "A 63-year-old woman undergoes right upper lobectomy via VATS for a 2.8-cm peripheral squamous cell carcinoma.
