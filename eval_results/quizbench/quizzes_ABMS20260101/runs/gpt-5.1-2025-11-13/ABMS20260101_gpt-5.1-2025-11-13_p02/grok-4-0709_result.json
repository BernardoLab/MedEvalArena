BP is 88/54 mm Hg, HR 78/min, JVP 15 cm with prominent v waves, and there is a holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border that increases with inspiration. Echo shows severe functional tricuspid regurgitation with right atrial and RV dilation, TAPSE 1.0 cm, RV fractional area change 25%, PASP 42 mm Hg, and no significant left-sided valvular disease. Coronary anatomy is unchanged from prior and not revascularizable. He is in sinus rhythm and not a heart transplant candidate. After optimization of diuretics, he remains symptomatic.
