Oncologic control: A 3.8 cm enhancing solid mass is highly suspicious for RCC and requires treatment. This is a T1a tumor (<4 cm).\n\n2. Renal preservation: With eGFR 32 and a compromised contralateral kidney, preserving nephrons is critical to avoid dialysis.\n\n3. Surgical risk: Prior CABG increases surgical risk, but patient is functionally independent.\n\nEvaluating Options:\n\nA. Open radical nephrectomy with lymph node dissection - Would remove entire kidney, likely pushing patient toward dialysis. Lymph node dissection not indicated for T1a tumors. Too aggressive.\n\nB. Laparoscopic radical nephrectomy - Still removes entire kidney, unacceptable given CKD stage 3b and compromised contralateral kidney.\n\nC. Open partial nephrectomy with cooling and renorrhaphy - Nephron-sparing approach. For a 3.8 cm tumor, partial nephrectomy is standard of care when technically feasible. Intraoperative cooling helps protect remaining nephrons during ischemia. This preserves renal function while providing excellent oncologic control.\n\nD. Percutaneous cryoablation - While less invasive, 3.8 cm is at the upper limit for ablative therapies (typically best for tumors <3 cm). Higher recurrence rates compared to surgical excision. Generally reserved for patients who are poor surgical candidates.\n\nE. Active surveillance - Appropriate for small renal masses (<2-3 cm) in elderly or comorbid patients, but 3.8 cm is larger and the patient is functionally independent with reasonable life expectancy.\n\nBest Answer:\nGiven the need to balance oncologic control (3.8 cm suspicious mass) with renal preservation (CKD 3b, compromised contralateral kidney), partial nephrectomy is the gold standard. The patient is functionally independent and can tolerate surgery despite comorbidities. Open approach with cooling provides optimal nephron preservation during the procedure.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p02", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p02-003", "question": "A 41-year-old woman presents with progressive right-sided nasal obstruction, intermittent epistaxis, and hyposmia.

Shortening pedicle with direct reanastomosis after partial debulking\n- The original problem was that an 11-cm graft was needed to reach the IMV, suggesting the pedicle was too short. Debulking won't significantly shorten the required reach. This doesn't solve the fundamental length problem.\n\nB. Retrograde IMV via contralateral perforator with interposition graft\n- The contralateral IM system is \"occupied\" by the left flap, but perforators could potentially be used. However, this requires another long interposition graft, which was the original problem.\n\nC. Venous cross-over to contralateral DIEP flap SIEV\n- This is a recognized salvage technique. The SIEV (superficial inferior epigastric vein) of the contralateral flap can serve as venous outflow. Cross-chest venous anastomosis is a described technique for venous salvage when ipsilateral options are exhausted. This uses an already-established, functioning venous system.\n\nD. Conversion to pedicled TRAM\n- This would require the inferior epigastric vessels to still be intact and connected to the flap. In a DIEP flap, these vessels are divided during harvest. The flap cannot be converted back to a pedicled flap once the pedicle has been divided and the flap transferred.\n\nE. Complete flap removal and delayed reconstruction\n- This abandons the flap entirely. While safe, it doesn't attempt salvage and results in flap loss.\n\nBest answer: Option C - The cross-chest venous anastomosis to the contralateral DIEP's SIEV is a well-described salvage technique. The contralateral flap has established venous drainage, and using its superficial venous system (SIEV) as an outflow for the congested flap provides reliable drainage without requiring another long venous graft to a distant recipient vein.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p02", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p02-006", "question": "A 54-year-old man with a 2.2-cm pituitary macroadenoma causing acromegaly undergoes endoscopic endonasal resection.

The mechanism is release of preformed ADH from degenerating posterior pituitary neurons.\n\nOption A describes \"persistent SIADH from hypothalamic neuronal injury\" - this is essentially describing the second phase of the triphasic response where damaged neurons release stored ADH.\n\nThe triphasic pattern here: Day 1 (possible mild DI) → Day 7-12 (SIADH from ADH release).

V5 <40% while relaxing V20 and MLD - Low-dose spread (V5) has been associated with pneumonitis, particularly in some studies. However, relaxing V20 and MLD constraints could be dangerous. In ILD patients, higher doses are particularly concerning.\n\nE. Heart V30 <30% - This prioritizes cardiac sparing over lung protection, which is inappropriate given the severe ILD and high pneumonitis risk.\n\nFor patients with severe ILD, the most critical approach is to minimize overall lung dose exposure. MLD is a robust predictor of pneumonitis risk. Keeping MLD <10 Gy (much stricter than the typical <20 Gy) represents the most protective approach.
