Observation - Inappropriate; this is a malignancy requiring treatment, not a spontaneously remitting condition.\n\nB. Immediate HSCT without induction - Premature; patients need to achieve remission first before transplantation. HSCT in first remission is appropriate AFTER induction chemotherapy.\n\nC. AML-type intensive induction followed by high-dose cytarabine consolidation - This is standard for AML. Given the high-risk cytogenetics (t(8;16)), intensive chemotherapy followed by HSCT in first remission would be appropriate. This is the correct initial management.\n\nD.

Evaluating options:\n   - A: Adding fluoxetine is reasonable, but monotherapy with antidepressant without psychotherapy is suboptimal\n   - B: Discontinuing lithium is unnecessary and risky; clomipramine (tricyclic) carries higher mood destabilization risk\n   - C: Increasing quetiapine alone won't treat OCD; avoiding antidepressants is overly cautious given stability\n   - D: CBT with ERP is first-line for OCD and can be combined with pharmacotherapy; maintains current stable regimen\n   - E: Risperidone doesn't have superior efficacy for OCD; unnecessary switch\n\nBest Answer:\nOption D is most appropriate because:\n- CBT with ERP is evidence-based first-line treatment for OCD\n- Maintains current effective mood stabilizer regimen\n- Can be combined with pharmacotherapy if needed\n- Avoids unnecessary medication changes in a stable patient\n- Addresses the OCD directly with the most effective psychological intervention\n\nThe answer is D"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p04-007", "question": "A 46-year-old woman undergoes laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for morbid obesity.

The clustered dilated small bowel and decompressed distal bowel support small bowel obstruction from an internal hernia.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis:\n1. Internal hernia (most likely given CT findings) - common complication after RYGB, can occur through:\n   - Petersen's defect (between Roux limb and remnant stomach mesentery)\n   - Mesenteric defect at jejunojejunostomy\n   \n2. Anastomotic stricture - ruled out by \"no obvious anastomotic leak\" and acute presentation\n3.
