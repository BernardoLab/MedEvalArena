Bone marrow examination reveals hypercellularity with dysplastic precursors and 12% myeloblasts. Crucially, cytogenetics reveal a t(8;16)(p11;p13) translocation involving KAT6A (MOZ) and CREBBP. This specific translocation is an AML-defining abnormality, classifying the patient as having acute myeloid leukemia (AML), even though the blast percentage is below the traditional 20% threshold. The aberrant expression of CD56 and bright CD7 on myeloid blasts further supports this diagnosis and characterizes a specific AML subtype. The diffuse histiocytic hemophagocytosis (HH) is likely a secondary phenomenon driven by the underlying malignancy.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA.  Observation with serial CBCs because this cytogenetic abnormality is associated with spontaneous remission: Acute myeloid leukemia, especially with aggressive genetic translocations like t(8;16), is a malignant process that requires urgent treatment. Spontaneous remission does not occur in AML. This option is incorrect.\n\nB.  Immediate allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in first remission without induction chemotherapy: This option is contradictory and medically implausible. To be in \"first remission\" implies that remission has been achieved, which is typically accomplished through induction chemotherapy. Performing a stem cell transplant \"without induction chemotherapy\" for a newly diagnosed AML patient with active disease is not standard practice. While allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a crucial consolidative therapy for high-risk AML, it is usually performed after achieving remission. Furthermore, \"immediate\" transplantation without prior induction chemotherapy would mean transplanting a patient with active leukemia.\n\nC.  AML-type intensive induction chemotherapy followed by high-dose cytarabine consolidation: This represents the standard and most appropriate initial management strategy for acute myeloid leukemia in children and adults. Induction chemotherapy aims to achieve complete remission by eliminating the majority of leukemia cells. For high-risk AML, such as that associated with the t(8;16) translocation, intensive consolidation therapy, often including high-dose cytarabine, is standard to eradicate residual disease. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation might be considered as a further step after consolidation chemotherapy for very high-risk patients, but induction chemotherapy is the essential first stage.\n\nD.  ALL-type induction followed by maintenance therapy due to frequent lymphoid involvement: The patient's presentation, bone marrow findings (myeloid precursors and blasts), and the specific t(8;16) translocation strongly indicate AML, not acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). While some AML subtypes can express lymphoid markers aberrantly, this does not change the fundamental classification or the treatment approach required for AML.\n\nE.  HLH-directed immunochemotherapy (etoposide, dexamethasone) alone given the hemophagocytic features: The hemophagocytosis is a secondary complication of the underlying AML. While HLH can be treated with etoposide and dexamethasone, this addresses the reactive process but not the underlying malignancy driving it. The primary strategy must be to treat the AML clone. Once the AML is controlled, the secondary HLH is expected to resolve. Therefore, HLH-directed therapy alone is not the correct initial management strategy for this patient.\n\nBased on standard pediatric hematology oncology practice and the diagnosis of AML with a high-risk cytogenetic abnormality, intensive induction chemotherapy is the essential first step.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p04-003", "question": "A 62-year-old woman with COPD (FEV1 35% predicted) presents with acute dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain.

Chest CT angiogram confirms a large saddle PE, and bedside echo shows RV dilation and dysfunction. These findings classify the PE as massive and life-threatening, necessitating urgent intervention to restore hemodynamic stability.\n\nThe primary goal in massive PE with shock is reperfusion therapy to reduce the embolic burden and improve right ventricular function and systemic circulation. The available options for reperfusion are systemic thrombolysis, catheter-directed thrombolysis, and surgical pulmonary embolectomy.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\nA. Systemic thrombolysis with IV alteplase: This is the standard of care for massive PE with hemodynamic instability. It is rapid and can quickly improve clinical status. The patient has no absolute contraindications to thrombolysis mentioned (e.g., active bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, recent major surgery/trauma). The prophylactic dose of LMWH 24 hours ago is a relative contraindication, but in a life-threatening situation like massive PE with shock, the benefit of thrombolysis often outweighs the increased bleeding risk, especially after only a single prophylactic dose.\n\nB. Catheter-directed thrombolysis with local tPA infusion: This is a less invasive alternative to systemic thrombolysis, often reserved for patients with contraindications to systemic thrombolysis or when systemic thrombolysis fails. It is generally slower to achieve reperfusion and may not be the most appropriate *immediate* intervention when systemic therapy is feasible and indicated.\n\nC. Emergent surgical pulmonary embolectomy: This is a treatment option for massive PE, typically considered when thrombolysis is contraindicated or fails, or in specific patient populations. It is a major surgical procedure and usually not the first-line *immediate* intervention unless there are clear contraindications to thrombolysis or rapid deterioration that cannot be addressed by thrombolysis.\n\nD. IV unfractionated heparin alone with close hemodynamic monitoring: While therapeutic anticoagulation is essential for all patients with PE, it is insufficient as the sole treatment for massive PE causing hemodynamic instability. Anticoagulation prevents further clot formation but does not actively dissolve existing clots causing obstruction.\n\nE. Half-dose systemic tPA because of recent LMWH exposure: There is no standard protocol for administering \"half-dose\" systemic tPA in this context. The decision is typically to proceed with standard dosing if thrombolysis is indicated and contraindications are carefully weighed, or to choose an alternative reperfusion strategy.\n\nConsidering the patient's critical hemodynamic status due to massive PE, immediate reperfusion therapy is essential. Systemic thrombolysis (Option A) offers the most rapid potential for improvement and is the first-line treatment in such cases, provided there are no absolute contraindications. The previous prophylactic LMWH dose represents a relative contraindication that requires careful risk-benefit assessment, but it does not typically preclude systemic thrombolysis in a life-threatening PE with shock.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p04-004", "question": "A 29-year-old woman with a history of two early first-trimester miscarriages and one unexplained fetal demise at 28 weeks presents for preconception counseling.

This constellation of findings establishes the diagnosis of obstetric APS. The management of obstetric APS aims to prevent further pregnancy complications, primarily fetal loss and preeclampsia.\n\nCurrent guidelines for the management of obstetric APS recommend a combination of low-dose aspirin and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in pregnant women with APS and a history of pregnancy loss.

Hypoxemia (SpO₂ 89% despite FiO₂ 1.0): Indicates significant impairment of oxygenation.\n3.  Absent breath sounds over the left lung and harsh sounds over the right: This is a critical finding highly suggestive of an endotracheal tube lodged in the right mainstem bronchus. The right mainstem bronchus is more anterior and straighter, making it more susceptible to accidental intubation when the tube is advanced too deep. This would result in ventilation primarily (or exclusively) to the right lung, leading to absent breath sounds on the left.\n4.  Normal capnography waveform: Confirms tracheal intubation and patency but does not differentiate between correct tracheal placement and mainstem intubation.\n5.

The unilateral absent breath sounds make bronchospasm an unlikely primary diagnosis.\n\nB.  Withdraw the endotracheal tube slightly while listening for bilateral breath sounds: This is the classic and most appropriate immediate intervention for suspected mainstem bronchial intubation. By withdrawing the tube slightly while auscultating the chest, one can reposition the tube tip back into the trachea, restoring ventilation to both lungs and resolving the unilateral absent breath sounds and severe hypoxemia.\n\nC.  Place a left chest tube for suspected tension pneumothorax: A tension pneumothorax causes severe respiratory distress, absent breath sounds on the affected side, and often hemodynamic instability with tracheal deviation. While absent breath sounds are present, the patient has stable hemodynamics, and the pattern of absent sounds on the left with harsh sounds on the right strongly points to endobronchial intubation rather than a pneumothorax. A chest tube would not correct endobronchial intubation.\n\nD.

While her euthymia for 18 months might lower this risk, it's not a negligible concern.\n\nB. Discontinue lithium and start clomipramine to target obsessive-compulsive symptoms: Clomipramine is a potent TCA for OCD. However, discontinuing lithium, a highly effective mood stabilizer for bipolar disorder, without clear indication (like toxicity, side effect, or non-response for bipolar disorder management) would be inappropriate and could destabilize her mood. Lithium is essential for her bipolar disorder management.\n\nC. Increase quetiapine dose and avoid antidepressants to prevent mood switching: Quetiapine, an atypical antipsychotic, has mood-stabilizing properties and can have some augmentation effect in treating depression and potentially OCD symptoms at higher doses. While avoiding antidepressants is a prudent measure in some bipolar patients, increasing quetiapine is not typically the most targeted or first-line approach for significant OCD symptoms, especially when psychotherapy is an option.\n\nD. Initiate cognitive-behavioral therapy with exposure and response prevention while continuing current medications: Cognitive-behavioral therapy, specifically Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP), is the gold standard psychosocial treatment for OCD and is highly effective. Given the patient has insight, she is a good candidate for ERP. Continuing her current mood stabilizers ensures her bipolar disorder remains stable while she receives effective treatment for her new OCD symptoms. This approach addresses both aspects of her presentation safely and effectively.\n\nE. Switch quetiapine to risperidone, which has superior efficacy for obsessive-compulsive symptoms: While atypical antipsychotics can have some role in OCD, there is no definitive evidence that risperidone has superior efficacy for OCD compared to quetiapine, nor is switching antipsychotics the primary step for treating new-onset OCD if other treatments and therapies are available.\n\nConsidering the patient's presentation, the most appropriate next step is to initiate psychotherapy specifically for OCD, given its evidence base and the patient's insight, while maintaining her current effective mood stabilizer regimen to prevent relapse of bipolar disorder.\n\nThe answer is (D)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p04-007", "question": "A 46-year-old woman undergoes laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for morbid obesity.

These symptoms, combined with CT findings of swirling mesenteric vessels in the left upper quadrant, clustered dilated small bowel in the upper abdomen, and a decompressed distal small bowel, are highly suggestive of an internal hernia. An internal hernia is a serious complication of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass that can lead to bowel ischemia and necrosis if not treated promptly. The swirling mesenteric vessels described are a classic sign of visceral congestion and potential strangulation associated with internal hernias.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. Urgent diagnostic laparoscopy with reduction of internal hernia and closure of mesenteric defects: This is the most appropriate management. The symptoms and CT findings strongly suggest an internal hernia, which is a surgical emergency. Laparoscopy allows for direct visualization, reduction of the hernia, and repair of mesenteric defects, which can prevent compromise of bowel viability.\n\nB. Nasogastric decompression, IV fluids, and serial abdominal examinations with repeat CT in 24 hours: This is conservative management for uncomplicated small bowel obstruction. However, the presence of swirling mesenteric vessels indicates a potential compromise of blood supply, making conservative management potentially dangerous and leading to delay in definitive treatment for a surgical emergency.\n\nC. Upper GI contrast study to evaluate for gastrojejunal anastomotic stricture before considering surgery: While strictures can occur after gastric bypass, the CT findings of swirling mesenteric vessels are more indicative of an internal hernia. Focusing on the gastrojejunal anastomosis might miss a more critical issue like an internal hernia. Moreover, an upper GI study adds time, and immediate surgical intervention is warranted given the suspected diagnosis.\n\nD. Exploratory laparotomy with resection of the Roux limb and reversal of the bypass anatomy: Exploratory laparotomy is a more invasive approach than laparoscopy. Reversal is a drastic measure typically reserved for irreversible complications or if the patient is too unstable for minimally invasive surgery. Laparoscopy is preferred for diagnosis and initial management of suspected internal hernias in the postoperative period unless contraindicated.\n\nE. Endoscopic evaluation with balloon dilation of suspected jejunojejunostomy narrowing: Endoscopy is useful for evaluating and treating anastomotic strictures where balloon dilation might be effective. However, the prominent CT finding of swirling mesenteric vessels points away from a simple anastomotic narrowing and towards a mechanical obstruction with vascular compromise, which is not treatable endoscopically.\n\nTherefore, urgent diagnostic laparoscopy is the most appropriate immediate management.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p04-008", "question": "A 59-year-old man with a history of MI and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation presents with acute-onset right eye visual loss described as a \"curtain\" descending over 10 minutes, now partially improved.

The primary risk factors identified in his history are myocardial infarction (MI) and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). He is currently taking apixaban 5 mg twice daily, which is an appropriate anticoagulant dose for stroke prevention in non-valvular AF.\n\nThe BRAO is consistent with an embolic event. The most likely sources of emboli in this patient are his atrial fibrillation or atherosclerotic disease (post-MI, though MRA of head/neck showed no significant stenosis or large-vessel occlusion). Paradoxical emboli through a patent foramen ovale are less common but possible.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\n*   A. Continue apixaban and add aspirin 81 mg daily indefinitely: Adding aspirin to a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) like apixaban increases the risk of bleeding without clear evidence of superior benefit over anticoagulation alone in most scenarios for AF-related stroke prevention, especially when arterial sources are not strongly implicated. While dual therapy is sometimes considered for patients with both cardioembolic and arterial risk factors, the MRA was normal, making significant arterial embolic sources less likely.\n\n*   B. Switch apixaban to warfarin with target INR 2.5-3.5: Apixaban is a DOAC and is generally preferred over warfarin for stroke prevention in non-valvular AF due to similar or better efficacy and a lower risk of serious bleeding, especially intracranial hemorrhage. There is no indication to switch from a well-functioning DOAC to warfarin unless specific contraindications to DOACs exist, which are not mentioned here.\n\n*   C. Continue apixaban at the same dose without change: The patient has paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, a known risk factor for embolization. Apixaban is indicated to reduce this risk. The BRAO, while a concerning event, occurred despite anticoagulation. However, the most direct approach to prevent further cardioembolic events from AF is to continue effective anticoagulation. Further investigation (e.g., echocardiogram, Holter monitor) would be warranted to assess the AF burden and look for other sources, but maintaining the current antithrombotic regimen for AF is the most appropriate initial step as it addresses the primary identified etiology.\n\n*   D. Increase apixaban dose to 10 mg twice daily for 1 month, then 5 mg twice daily: The standard doses for apixaban are 2.5 mg BID or 5 mg BID. There is no evidence-based recommendation for a temporary increase to 10 mg BID for the management of retinal artery occlusion. Such an increase would significantly elevate bleeding risk without established benefit.\n\n*   E. Discontinue anticoagulation and use dual antiplatelet therapy for 90 days: Discontinuing anticoagulation in a patient with atrial fibrillation would remove essential protection against stroke and other thromboembolic events, increasing their risk significantly. Dual antiplatelet therapy is not the standard of care for preventing cardioembolic stroke from AF.\n\nGiven the patient's paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which is the most likely source of emboli, continuing apixaban at the current dose (5 mg twice daily) is the most appropriate strategy. Further workup might be initiated to confirm adherence, assess the AF burden, and investigate for other potential embolic sources, but the antithrombotic regimen should primarily address the proven cardiac risk factor.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p04-009", "question": "A 46-year-old man presents with sudden severe tearing chest pain radiating to the back.

This constitutes a malperfusion syndrome, which is an indication for intervention in Type B dissections.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\nA. Immediate thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) to prevent late aneurysmal degeneration: TEVAR is the standard endovascular approach for complicated Type B dissections, including those with malperfusion. While prevention of aneurysmal degeneration is a long-term benefit, the primary immediate indication for TEVAR in this case is the renal malperfusion syndrome. TEVAR aims to cover the intimal tear, redirect flow into the true lumen, and promote its expansion, thus restoring perfusion to compromised branch vessels.\n\nB. Open surgical repair of the descending thoracic aorta due to renal artery involvement: Open surgical repair is typically reserved for cases where endovascular repair is not feasible or has failed, or in specific anatomies. For Type B dissections, particularly distal ones, TEVAR is generally preferred due to lower morbidity and mortality.\n\nC. Strict medical therapy with anti-impulse control and serial imaging: Strict medical therapy is the cornerstone for *uncomplicated* Type B aortic dissections. However, this patient has a complication (renal malperfusion), making medical therapy alone insufficient.\n\nD. Prophylactic left renal artery stenting plus medical therapy: While renal malperfusion is present, simply stenting the renal artery might only be a temporizing measure or may not address the underlying issue of the aortic dissection flap obstructing the true lumen at the origin of the renal artery. Addressing the aortic dissection itself is usually the primary goal.\n\nE. Fenestration and true lumen expansion with balloon angioplasty: Fenestration (creating a hole in the intimal flap) and balloon angioplasty of the true lumen are specific endovascular techniques used to restore flow to compromised branch vessels. These techniques can be effective in treating renal malperfusion due to dissection. They directly address the stenosed true lumen. However, they are often considered as adjuncts to TEVAR if malperfusion persists, or as primary treatments in specific, highly selected cases or when full TEVAR is not feasible or desired.\n\nConsidering the extent of the dissection (distal to LSA extending to the infrarenal aorta) and the presence of malperfusion, TEVAR is the generally accepted first-line intervention strategy. The procedure aims to seal the primary entry tear and promote re-expansion of the true lumen, thereby resolving the malperfusion to the renal artery. While option E describes procedures that directly target the compromised lumen, TEVAR is the broader and more established strategy for managing malperfusion in Type B dissection. In this case, TEVAR would cover the dissection flap and intendedly expand the true lumen from which the renal artery arises.\n\nThe most appropriate management strategy, given a complicated Type B dissection with renal malperfusion, is intervention.

Classify as noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP) and no further therapy: NIFTP specifically excludes capsular and vascular invasion. Since this lesion has both, it cannot be classified as NIFTP.\n\nB.  Classify as minimally invasive follicular thyroid carcinoma and recommend routine radioactive iodine ablation: This lesion does show features of follicular carcinoma (capsular and vascular invasion). \"Minimally invasive\" often refers to limited capsular invasion and minimal vascular invasion. The term \"focal intracapsular vascular invasion\" suggests minimal vascular involvement. However, \"routine radioactive iodine ablation\" is generally not recommended for low-risk differentiated thyroid carcinoma according to current guidelines (e.g., American Thyroid Association).\n\nC.  Classify as encapsulated angioinvasive follicular variant papillary thyroid carcinoma and consider RAI only if postoperative thyroglobulin is detectable: If the follicular-patterned lesion also had papillary nuclear features, it would be classified as follicular variant papillary thyroid carcinoma (FVPTC). Angioinvasion is present. For encapsulated FVPTC with angioinvasion, no ETE, and no nodal involvement, it is typically considered low-risk. While RAI might be considered for intermediate risk, the criteria for considering RAI (postoperative thyroglobulin) in this choice are not the primary basis for initial risk stratification. Moreover, the management in option D is more specific to low-risk disease.\n\nD.  Classify as low-risk differentiated thyroid carcinoma managed with levothyroxine to keep TSH mildly suppressed and no routine RAI: A follicular-patterned lesion with capsular invasion and focal intracapsular vascular invasion, without extrathyroidal extension or lymph node metastasis, falls into the category of low-risk differentiated thyroid carcinoma (either follicular thyroid carcinoma or follicular variant papillary thyroid carcinoma without other aggressive features). For low-risk differentiated thyroid carcinoma, the recommended initial postoperative management typically includes levothyroxine therapy to keep TSH mildly suppressed (usually between 0.1-0.5 mIU/L) to reduce the risk of recurrence, and radioactive iodine ablation is generally *not* routinely recommended due to its limited benefit in this risk group and potential side effects. This option accurately describes both the classification and the appropriate postoperative management.\n\nE.  Classify as high-risk due to vascular invasion and treat with high-dose RAI and aggressive TSH suppression (<0.1 mIU/L): High-risk features for thyroid cancer typically include distant metastases, gross extrathyroidal extension, poorly differentiated histology, or extensive lymph node involvement. Focal intracapsular vascular invasion, without other adverse factors, is not usually sufficient to classify a tumor as high-risk prompting high-dose RAI and aggressive TSH suppression.\n\nBased on the analysis, option D is the most appropriate choice.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$."}]
