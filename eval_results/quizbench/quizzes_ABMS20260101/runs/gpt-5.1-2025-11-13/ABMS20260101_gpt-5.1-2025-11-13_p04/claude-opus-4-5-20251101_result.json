Observation would not be appropriate.\n\nB. Immediate HSCT without induction: Transplant is typically performed after achieving remission with induction chemotherapy, not as initial therapy.\n\nC. AML-type intensive induction followed by high-dose cytarabine consolidation: This is the standard approach for AML. The t(8;16) translocation defines this as AML regardless of blast percentage. Standard AML induction (typically cytarabine + anthracycline) followed by consolidation is appropriate.\n\nD. ALL-type induction: Despite CD7 expression (which can be aberrant in AML), this is clearly myeloid lineage disease, not ALL.\n\nE. HLH-directed therapy alone: While hemophagocytosis is present, this is secondary to the underlying malignancy.

While she's on mood stabilizers, adding high-dose fluoxetine still carries some risk.\n\nOption B (Discontinue lithium, start clomipramine): This is dangerous - stopping lithium removes mood stabilization, and clomipramine (a TCA) has higher switch risk than SSRIs. This could precipitate mania.\n\nOption C (Increase quetiapine, avoid antidepressants): While quetiapine augmentation is used in OCD, increasing it as monotherapy for OCD is not evidence-based as first-line treatment. Avoiding all antidepressants may be overly conservative.\n\nOption D (CBT with ERP while continuing current medications): Cognitive-behavioral therapy with exposure and response prevention (ERP) is the gold-standard psychological treatment for OCD. It has excellent efficacy (comparable to medications), no risk of mood switching, and maintains her stable mood regimen. Guidelines recommend ERP as first-line for OCD.\n\nOption E (Switch to risperidone): There's no evidence that risperidone is superior to quetiapine for OCD. In fact, some atypical antipsychotics can worsen OCD symptoms.\n\nThe best approach for a bipolar patient with new OCD symptoms is to:\n1. Maintain mood stability (keep current medications)\n2.

Etiology of BRAO: This patient has atrial fibrillation, which is a known embolic source. BRAO is typically caused by emboli (cardiac or carotid sources). MRA shows no significant carotid stenosis, suggesting the embolus likely originated from the heart (AFib-related).\n\n2. Current Anticoagulation Status: He's on appropriate anticoagulation with apixaban 5 mg BID for AFib and is adherent. Despite this, he had an embolic event.\n\nEvaluating Options:\n\nA. Add aspirin to apixaban: The AUGUSTUS trial and other studies show that adding aspirin to anticoagulation increases bleeding risk without clear benefit in stable AFib patients. This is generally not recommended unless there's a specific indication (like recent ACS or PCI with stent).\n\nB. Switch to warfarin INR 2.5-3.5: Higher intensity anticoagulation is typically reserved for mechanical heart valves. There's no evidence this would be superior to DOACs for AFib, and it increases bleeding risk.\n\nC. Continue apixaban without change: The patient is already on appropriate anticoagulation for AFib. Breakthrough events can occur even with proper anticoagulation. The standard of care for AFib-related stroke prevention is maintained. There's no evidence that changing the regimen would provide additional benefit.\n\nD. Increase apixaban dose: 10 mg BID is not a standard or approved dosing regimen. This would significantly increase bleeding risk without proven benefit.\n\nE. Discontinue anticoagulation for DAPT: This would be inappropriate for a patient with AFib who needs anticoagulation for stroke prevention. DAPT alone doesn't adequately prevent cardioembolic events.\n\nConclusion: Despite the breakthrough event, the patient is on appropriate therapy. Retinal artery occlusions can occur even with proper anticoagulation. There's no evidence-based reason to change his regimen.
