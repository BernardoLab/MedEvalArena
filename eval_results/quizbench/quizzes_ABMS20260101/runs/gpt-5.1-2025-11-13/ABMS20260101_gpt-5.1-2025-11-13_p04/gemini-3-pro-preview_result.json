Meds: The patient is taking zolpidem (a sedative-hypnotic) and sertraline (an SSRI), both of which significantly increase the risk of falls. A medication review to deprescribe zolpidem is a high-priority, evidence-based intervention.\n2.  Vitamin D: The USPSTF (2018) recommends against vitamin D supplementation to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults (Grade D recommendation). Studies (such as the VITAL and STURDY trials) have shown that high-dose vitamin D does not prevent falls and may even increase fall risk in some populations. Therefore, recommending the full program including \"high-dose vitamin D\" (Option A) or starting it (Option C) is incorrect.\n3.  Exercise Intensity and Capability: While exercise is a pillar of fall prevention, an \"intensive\" supervised strength training program 5 days/week may be overly burdensome and unrealistic for a frail 88-year-old (CFS 6) with dementia who is recovering from hospitalization.

Deferring Treatment: Deferring interventions (Option D) is inappropriate because the patient has identifiable risk factors (gait disorder requiring a walker, frailty, cognitive impairment, high-risk medications) that warrant proactive management.\n\nOption B is the most appropriate choice.

It may be considered in cases of recurrent early miscarriage only, though combination therapy is still often preferred.\n*   B: Therapeutic-dose LMWH is indicated for patients with a history of prior thrombosis. Using therapeutic dosing in a patient without prior thrombosis increases the risk of bleeding complications without proven benefit over prophylactic dosing.\n*   C: Prophylactic-dose LMWH plus low-dose aspirin is the correct drug and dosing regimen for this patient's risk profile (Obstetric APS).

Clomipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, is also highly associated with inducing mania in bipolar patients.\n*   C. Increase quetiapine dose: Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), particularly those with strong 5-HT2A antagonism like quetiapine, olanzapine, and clozapine, are associated with *inducing* or exacerbating OCD symptoms (medication-induced OCD). Increasing the dose would likely worsen the symptoms.\n*   D. Initiate cognitive-behavioral therapy with exposure and response prevention while continuing current medications: This is the most appropriate next step. Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) with Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) is a first-line, evidence-based treatment for OCD. It is safe to use in patients with Bipolar Disorder as it does not carry a risk of mood switching or drug interactions. Since the patient is euthymic and has insight, she is an excellent candidate for this intervention. It allows the clinician to wish to treat the functional impairment without destabilizing the successful mood regimen.\n*   E. Switch quetiapine to risperidone: Risperidone is also a second-generation antipsychotic with potent 5-HT2A antagonism and is frequently implicated in the induction of de novo OCD symptoms (similar to quetiapine). While it is sometimes used as an augmentation strategy for treatment-resistant OCD in non-bipolar patients, switching to it as a primary intervention for new-onset OCD in this context is not the best strategy and risks destabilizing the patient's mood or continuing the side effect.\n\nThe answer is (D)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_p04-007", "question": "A 46-year-old woman undergoes laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for morbid obesity.

While they are more common after significant weight loss, they can occur in the early postoperative period if defects were not closed or closed inadequately.

Surgical exploration is necessary to reduce the hernia, untwist the bowel, assess viability, and close the defects to prevent recurrence. Laparoscopy is feasible and preferred if the patient is stable.\n*   B.
