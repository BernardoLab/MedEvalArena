After potassium replacement, the sodium rose rapidly from 105 to 112 mEq/L (7 mEq/L increase in 2 hours).\n\nThis is a classic clinical scenario where potassium replacement causes an unexpected rapid rise in sodium.\n\nThe key physiological principle here involves the relationship between potassium and sodium at the cellular level:\n\n- Potassium is primarily an intracellular cation\n- Sodium is primarily an extracellular cation\n- The Na+/K+-ATPase pump maintains these gradients\n\nWhen potassium is administered:\n1. Potassium moves into cells to replenish intracellular stores\n2. To maintain electroneutrality, sodium moves OUT of cells into the extracellular space\n3. This effectively raises the serum sodium concentration\n\nThis is essentially an intracellular-to-extracellular shift. However, looking at the options more carefully:\n\nOption B states \"Intracellular sodium shift in exchange for potassium\" - this wording is a bit confusing. If we interpret this as sodium shifting FROM intracellular TO extracellular in exchange for potassium moving INTO cells, this would be correct.\n\nThe other options:\n- A: Osmotic demyelination doesn't release sodium; it's a consequence of rapid correction\n- C: Aldosterone suppression wouldn't cause rapid sodium rise\n- D: Volume expansion suppressing ADH isn't the primary mechanism here\n- E: Renal sodium retention wouldn't explain such rapid changes\n\nThe phenomenon is that when you give potassium, it enters cells, and sodium exits cells to maintain electrical neutrality. This raises serum sodium.

Hemophilia A (Carrier state): Hemophilia A is X-linked recessive. Female carriers typically have ~50% Factor VIII levels (range 30-70%). A level of 6% would be unusually low for a carrier.

However, 6% is too low for typical carrier state.\n\nB. Type 2N von Willebrand Disease: This is an autosomal recessive condition where vWF has a defective binding site for Factor VIII. vWF antigen and activity are normal, but Factor VIII is low because it cannot bind to vWF and is rapidly degraded. This fits perfectly with:\n- Normal vWF antigen\n- Normal vWF activity (Ristocetin cofactor)\n- Very low Factor VIII (6%)\n- Autosomal inheritance (father affected, can pass to daughters)\n\nC.
