Delayed reaction (3-6 hours post-meal) - this is characteristic, unlike typical IgE-mediated food allergies\n2. Positive intradermal but negative skin prick tests - alpha-gal reactions are often delayed hypersensitivity reactions\n3. IgE to alpha-gal - the epitope galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose found in mammalian meat (beef, pork, lamb)\n4. Normal tryptase - consistent with delayed reaction rather than acute anaphylaxis\n5. No history of atopy - AGS can occur in non-atopic individuals\n\nThe vector for alpha-gal sensitization:\n\nAmblyomma americanum (Lone Star tick) is the established vector for alpha-gal syndrome sensitization in North America. Tick bites introduce alpha-gal epitopes that lead to IgE sensitization. The Lone Star tick is found primarily in the southeastern and south-central United States.\n\nWhile Ixodes scapularis is known for Lyme disease transmission, it is not the vector for alpha-gal sensitization.
