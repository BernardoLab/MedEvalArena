The key differentiator is the peripheral tissue response. In TSHoma, peripheral tissues (like the liver) are sensitive to the high thyroid hormone levels, resulting in elevated markers of thyroid action such as Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG). In RTH, the peripheral tissues are resistant, so SHBG levels are typically normal. The pituitary lesion supports TSHoma, but incidentalomas are common; the metabolic profile (high SHBG) confirms the diagnosis.", "generator_model": "gemini-3-pro-preview", "seed": 123, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "target_topic": "Endocrine", "abms_specialty": "Endocrine", "abms_source": "topics_mapped", "source_label_raw": "endocrinology", "source_quiz_id": "20251129T125426901Z_gemini-3-pro-preview_seed123", "source_question_id": "20251129T125426901Z_gemini-3-pro-preview_seed123-008", "source_runs_root": "/home/dbernardo/Documents/pyres/MedEvalArena/eval_results/quizbench/quizzes_Jan2026/runs", "source_run_dir": "/home/dbernardo/Documents/pyres/MedEvalArena/eval_results/quizbench/quizzes_Jan2026/runs/gemini-3-pro-preview/20251129T125426901Z_gemini-3-pro-preview_seed123", "source_quiz_path": "/home/dbernardo/Documents/pyres/MedEvalArena/quizzes/quizzes_Jan2026_backup/20251129T125426901Z_gemini-3-pro-preview_seed123.jsonl", "pred": "B", "model_outputs": "The answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p03", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p03-002", "question": "A 52-year-old male presents with severe chronic watery diarrhea and 15 kg weight loss over 6 months.
