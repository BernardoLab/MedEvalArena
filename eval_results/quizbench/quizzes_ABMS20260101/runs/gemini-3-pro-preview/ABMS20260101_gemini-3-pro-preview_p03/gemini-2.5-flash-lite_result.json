The laboratory findings show a paradox: TSH is elevated (7.2 mIU/L), while Free T4 is also elevated (2.9 ng/dL). Normally, high levels of thyroid hormones (like Free T4) should suppress TSH production by the pituitary gland. Therefore, elevated TSH in the setting of elevated Free T4 suggests a problem with TSH regulation or thyroid hormone action.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\nA. Resistance to Thyroid Hormone (RTH) beta: In RTH, peripheral tissues and the pituitary gland are resistant to the effects of thyroid hormones. This leads to elevated circulating thyroid hormones (T4, T3) with inappropriately normal or elevated TSH levels, as the pituitary is less sensitive to negative feedback. Symptoms can range from euthyroid to hyperthyroid. This diagnosis can explain the lab pattern (high TSH, high FT4) and symptoms. However, RTH is a genetic disorder and does not typically cause a pituitary lesion.\n\nB. TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma (TSHoma): A TSHoma is a rare pituitary adenoma that autonomously secretes TSH. This excess TSH stimulates the thyroid gland inappropriately, leading to secondary hyperthyroidism. The expected laboratory findings are elevated TSH and elevated Free T4 (and Free T3). Symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as palpitations, are common. Importantly, a TSHoma is a pituitary lesion, and an MRI of the pituitary would show an adenoma. The description of a \"5mm hypoenhancing lesion\" on MRI is highly suggestive of a pituitary adenoma. This option explains all aspects of the case: the paradoxical labs, the hyperthyroid symptoms, and the pituitary lesion. Elevated SHBG is also consistent with hyperthyroidism.\n\nC. Graves' disease: Graves' disease is the most common cause of primary hyperthyroidism. In primary hyperthyroidism, the thyroid gland is overactive autonomously (usually due to TSH receptor autoantibodies). This leads to suppressed TSH levels (<0.01 mIU/L) and elevated Free T4 and Free T3. The patient's TSH is high, not low, making Graves' disease incorrect.\n\nD. Familial Dysalbuminemic Hyperthyroxinemia (FDH): FDH is a genetic disorder characterized by increased binding of T4 to albumin, leading to elevated total T4. However, Free T4 and TSH levels are typically normal, and the patient is usually euthyroid. While total T4 can be increased, the combination of high TSH and high Free T4 as seen here is not typical for FDH.\n\nE. Heterophile antibody interference: Interference by heterophile antibodies can cause falsely elevated or suppressed TSH and thyroid hormone levels in immunoassays. It can mimic hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. While it's a possibility for abnormal lab results, the presence of a specific structural abnormality on MRI (pituitary lesion) makes a specific diagnosis like a TSHoma a more likely explanation.\n\nConsidering all the provided information, the combination of elevated TSH, elevated Free T4, symptoms of palpitations, and a pituitary lesion on MRI makes a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma the most likely diagnosis. The TSHoma explains the pituitary lesion and the subsequent inappropriate TSH secretion leading to hyperthyroidism.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p03", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p03-002", "question": "A 52-year-old male presents with severe chronic watery diarrhea and 15 kg weight loss over 6 months.

Negative HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 genotyping, which are essential for celiac disease development.\n3.  Lack of clinical improvement after 8 weeks on a gluten-free diet (GFD).\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\nA.  Refractory Celiac Disease Type 1 (RCD-1): This diagnosis requires confirmed celiac disease that persists despite an adequate GFD. Since celiac disease is unlikely given the negative serology, negative HLA typing, and lack of response to the GFD, RCD-1 is not the most likely diagnosis. Furthermore, 8 weeks is a relatively short trial period to define refractoriness.\n\nB.  Autoimmune Enteropathy: This condition can present with villous atrophy and malabsorption, and it is typically seronegative for celiac disease markers. It's a diagnosis of exclusion when celiac disease is ruled out. While possible, other diagnoses should be considered first, especially if there is an identifiable trigger.\n\nC.  Olmesartan-associated Enteropathy: Olmesartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) that is a known cause of a sprue-like illness. This condition mimics celiac disease with symptoms of chronic diarrhea, weight loss, villous atrophy, and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes. Importantly, celiac serologies and HLA typing are typically negative in this condition. The patient is taking olmesartan for hypertension, making this a highly probable diagnosis. Withdrawal of olmesartan often leads to rapid improvement.\n\nD.  Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID): CVID can be associated with gastrointestinal manifestations, including malabsorption and villous atrophy due to immune dysregulation. However, the presentation here, particularly the drug history, makes olmesartan-associated enteropathy a more specific and likely cause. Without other clinical indicators of immunodeficiency or laboratory confirmation of low immunoglobulins, CVID is less likely to be the primary diagnosis than a drug-induced enteropathy.\n\nE.  Tropical Sprue: This is an acquired enteropathy caused by an infectious agent, typically seen in individuals who have traveled to or lived in tropical regions. There is no mention of travel history in the vignette, and the direct association with a medication makes olmesartan-associated enteropathy a more immediate consideration.\n\nGiven the patient's medication history (olmesartan) and the histological findings (total villous atrophy and increased IELs) that mimic celiac disease but occur in the context of negative celiac workup and lack of response to GFD, olmesartan-associated enteropathy is the most likely diagnosis.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p03", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p03-003", "question": "A 34-year-old male presents with progressive dyspnea.

Pleuroparenchymal Fibroelastosis (PPFE) is characterized by fibrosis predominantly in the subpleural regions of the upper lobes, often accompanied by apical pleural thickening and pleural fibrosis.

The administration of IV KCl aims to correct the potassium deficit. The observed rapid rise in serum sodium (from 105 to 112 mEq/L in two hours) requires an understanding of the physiological shifts occurring in response to potassium repletion in the setting of severe hypokalemia.\n\nIn severe hypokalemia, potassium shifts out of cells into the extracellular space, and to maintain electrical neutrality and cell volume, sodium ions (and hydrogen ions) tend to shift into cells. This intracellular accumulation of sodium contributes to the apparent hyponatremia, as the total body sodium might be normal or even increased, but trapped intracellularly.\n\nWhen potassium is administered intravenously (as KCl), it enters the cells, driven by the concentration gradient and facilitated by the Na+/K+-ATPase pump. This pump actively transports potassium ions into the cells and sodium ions out of the cells. For every two potassium ions pumped into the cell, three sodium ions are pumped out of the cell. As potassium re-enters the intracellular space, the increased activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase pump leads to a significant efflux of sodium from the intracellular compartment into the extracellular space. This outward movement of intracellular sodium directly increases the extracellular sodium concentration, thereby raising the serum sodium level. This mechanism can lead to a rapid correction of hyponatremia, especially when severe hypokalemia is being corrected.\n\nLet's evaluate the other options:\nA. Osmotic demyelination syndrome is a neurological complication that can occur from rapid correction of hyponatremia, not a mechanism causing the sodium rise itself.\nC. Aldosterone suppression would lead to sodium excretion and potentially lower serum sodium, not raise it.\nD. Volume expansion can suppress ADH, leading to free water excretion and an increase in serum sodium. While IV fluid administration can cause some volume expansion, the shift of intracellular water and solute (sodium) directly due to potassium correction is a more immediate and primary mechanism for the rapid sodium increase directly linked to KCl administration.\nE. Renal sodium retention implies an increase in sodium reabsorption by the kidneys, which would help raise serum sodium if the hyponatremia was due to sodium loss. However, the primary cause of severe hyponatremia is often water excess. While improved renal function from potassium repletion could indirectly impact sodium handling, the direct ionic shift is the most immediate and potent mechanism.\n\nTherefore, the intracellular shift of sodium in exchange for potassium, driven by the Na+/K+-ATPase pump restoring intracellular potassium and extruding intracellular sodium, is the primary physiological mechanism for this rapid rise in serum sodium.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p03", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p03-005", "question": "A 24-year-old female presents with menorrhagia and prolonged bleeding after a tooth extraction.

The mixing study correcting the aPTT indicates a factor deficiency rather than an inhibitor.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA.  Hemophilia A (Carrier state): Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive disorder. Females are typically carriers. A female carrier can have reduced Factor VIII levels if she has skewed X-chromosome inactivation. This would explain the low Factor VIII activity and prolonged aPTT. The father having a similar bleeding history is consistent with an inherited X-linked disorder being passed down. Brothers being unaffected is also consistent, as they inherit their X chromosome from their mother. Normal vWF antigen and ristocetin cofactor activity are also expected in Hemophilia A.\n\nB.  Type 2N von Willebrand Disease: This is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a defect in the binding of von Willebrand Factor (vWF) to Factor VIII. This impaired binding leads to premature degradation of Factor VIII, resulting in low Factor VIII levels, mimicking Hemophilia A. Crucially, in Type 2N vWD, the vWF molecule itself is functionally normal regarding its primary role in platelet adhesion and aggregation (as measured by ristocetin cofactor activity), and its quantity (antigen level) is also normal. This exact pattern of low Factor VIII activity with normal vWF antigen and normal vWF ristocetin cofactor activity is a hallmark of Type 2N vWD. The father's bleeding history is also consistent with an inherited disorder.\n\nC.  Type 2A von Willebrand Disease: Type 2A vWD is characterized by a deficiency in large vWF multimers. This usually leads to a reduced vWF functional activity (like ristocetin cofactor activity) that is disproportionately lower than the vWF antigen level. The normal vWF antigen (95%) and normal vWF Ristocetin Cofactor Activity (92%) in this patient make Type 2A vWD unlikely.\n\nD.  Acquired Hemophilia A: This is an autoimmune disorder where antibodies inhibit Factor VIII activity. A key feature is that a mixing study typically does *not* correct the prolonged aPTT, or it may even worsen it, due to the presence of inhibitors. The fact that the mixing study corrects the aPTT rules out acquired Hemophilia A.\n\nE.  Factor XI Deficiency: Factor XI deficiency would cause a prolonged aPTT with normal PT, but it would be the Factor XI activity that is low, not Factor VIII activity. The case explicitly states low Factor VIII activity.\n\nComparing options A and B:\nBoth Hemophilia A carrier state and Type 2N vWD can explain a female patient with low Factor VIII and a history of bleeding. However, the *specific laboratory findings* are highly informative. The combination of low Factor VIII activity with *normal vWF antigen and normal vWF ristocetin cofactor activity* is particularly characteristic of Type 2N von Willebrand Disease. While a carrier of Hemophilia A would also have normal vWF tests, this specific pattern is the diagnostic hallmark of 2N vWD, where the vWF molecule itself is not deficient or functionally impaired in binding platelets, but rather in binding Factor VIII.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p03", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p03-006", "question": "A 19-year-old male presents with recurrent fevers, livedo reticularis, and two episodes of lacunar ischemic stroke.

STAT3 gene mutations can lead to various immune dysregulation disorders, including Hyper-IgE Syndrome (HIES), characterized by eczema, recurrent infections, eosinophilia, and elevated IgE. While immune dysregulation is involved, the specific pattern of necrotizing vasculitis, stroke, livedo reticularis, and low IgM/IgG levels is not a hallmark of STAT3-related disorders.\n\nConsidering the combination of systemic vasculitis (necrotizing vasculitis, stroke, livedo reticularis), recurrent fevers, neutropenia, and evidence of immunodeficiency (low IgM/IgG), mutations in the ADA2 gene represent the most likely genetic cause.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p03", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p03-007", "question": "A 24-year-old male presents with recurrent fevers, livedo racemosa, and acute left hemiparesis.

This deficiency results in dysregulation of inflammatory pathways, particularly leading to increased production and sensitivity to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Consequently, inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis) and other systemic inflammatory manifestations occur.\n\nThe management of DADA2 typically involves suppressing the underlying inflammation.\n- TNF-alpha inhibitors are considered a highly effective treatment for DADA2.

Imaging shows no vegetations on echocardiography, and PET-CT reveals hypermetabolic activity in the spleen and bone marrow. Bone marrow biopsy shows non-caseating granulomas, and standard blood cultures are negative.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Sarcoidosis: This is a multisystem inflammatory disease characterized by non-caseating granulomas. It can cause FUO, weight loss, fatigue, pancytopenia (due to bone marrow involvement), and elevated liver enzymes (hepatic involvement). PET-CT can show hypermetabolic activity in affected organs. Sarcoidosis fits many of the clinical and histological findings. However, it does not have a direct, specific association with prosthetic valve replacement as a cause.\n\nB. Culture-negative endocarditis (HACEK group): HACEK organisms can cause subacute endocarditis and are often difficult to culture. Symptoms can overlap. However, the absence of vegetations on TEE makes active endocarditis less likely. Furthermore, HACEK endocarditis typically does not present with non-caseating granulomas in the bone marrow.\n\nC. Mycobacterium chimaera: This is a non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) that has been increasingly recognized as a cause of late prosthetic valve endocarditis and disseminated infection years after cardiac surgery. The infection can be indolent and present with FUO, weight loss, fatigue, and multiorgan involvement, including the spleen, liver, and bone marrow, which aligns with the PET-CT findings and lab results. Pancytopenia can occur due to bone marrow infiltration. While classic histological findings for some mycobacterial infections include caseating granulomas, NTM infections can elicit a granulomatous inflammatory response, and reports suggest non-caseating granulomas can be part of this spectrum in disseminated disease. The strong temporal link to the prosthetic valve replacement makes this a highly probable diagnosis, as *M. chimaera* specifically targets prosthetic materials. Negative blood cultures can occur with NTM infections due to their slow growth and specific culture requirements.\n\nD. Tropheryma whipplei: This organism causes Whipple's disease, which can affect multiple organ systems and involve cardiac valves. However, the hallmark histological finding is the presence of PAS-positive macrophages, not typically non-caseating granulomas.\n\nE. Late-onset prosthetic valve thrombosis: While thrombosis can occur, it typically presents with mechanical valve dysfunction symptoms (dyspnea, chest pain) rather than systemic inflammation with FUO, weight loss, pancytopenia, and granulomas.\n\nConsidering the patient's history of aortic valve replacement 4 years prior, the symptoms of FUO, weight loss, fatigue, pancytopenia, and involvement of the spleen and bone marrow are highly suggestive of a complication related to the prosthetic device. *Mycobacterium chimaera* is a well-established cause of late prosthetic valve infection with disseminated disease. While non-caseating granulomas are classically associated with sarcoidosis, they can also be part of the granulomatous reaction in chronic NTM infections.

Monotherapy can lead to paradoxical pathway activation and limited clinical benefit.\nB. Encorafenib plus Cetuximab: Encorafenib is a BRAF inhibitor, and cetuximab is an anti-EGFR antibody. Studies like the BEACON CRC trial have shown that this combination, often with chemotherapy, significantly improves outcomes for patients with BRAF V600E-mutated, KRAS/NRAS wild-type mCRC in later lines of therapy. This combination targets both the aberrant BRAF signaling and the EGFR pathway, which can help overcome resistance mechanisms.

The positive intradermal testing to red meat compared to negative skin prick tests is also consistent with this diagnosis, as alpha-gal allergy can sometimes present with such discrepancies.\n\nThe crucial aspect of the question is identifying the vector responsible for sensitization to alpha-gal. Alpha-gal syndrome is an acquired allergy to the oligosaccharide molecule galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose, which is found in the tissues of non-primate mammals. Sensitization to this molecule is primarily acquired through the bites of certain tick species.\n\nExtensive research has identified the Lone Star tick (*Amblyomma americanum*) as the most common vector for inducing alpha-gal sensitization, particularly in the southeastern and eastern United States. Bites from this tick introduce alpha-gal carbohydrate into the host's skin, triggering an immune response and the production of specific IgE antibodies against alpha-gal. Subsequent consumption of red meat then leads to allergic reactions.\n\nLet's consider the other options:\nA. *Ixodes scapularis* (Black-legged tick): While implicating other tick species in alpha-gal sensitization is ongoing, *Ixodes* species have been less consistently linked compared to *Amblyomma americanum*.\nC. *Dermacentor variabilis* (American Dog tick): There is less evidence linking this tick species to widespread alpha-gal sensitization.\nD. *Aedes aegypti* (Mosquito): Mosquito bites cause various vector-borne diseases but are not associated with alpha-gal sensitization or mammalian meat allergy.\nE. *Ctenocephalides felis* (Cat flea): Flea bites can cause allergic reactions in some individuals, but they do not induce alpha-gal syndrome.\n\nBased on the current scientific literature, *Amblyomma americanum* is overwhelmingly recognized as the primary vector responsible for the development of alpha-gal syndrome.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."}]
