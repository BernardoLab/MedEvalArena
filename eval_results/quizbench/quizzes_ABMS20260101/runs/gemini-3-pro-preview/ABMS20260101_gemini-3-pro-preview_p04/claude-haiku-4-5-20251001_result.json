Parietal and occipital lobe atrophy on MRI\n\nSyndrome Recognition:\nThis clinical triad of optic ataxia, simultanagnosia, and visual dysfunction constitutes Balint's syndrome, which results from bilateral parietal-occipital pathology.\n\nAnalysis of Options:\n\nA. Lewy Body Disease - Typically presents with parkinsonism, hallucinations, and fluctuating cognition. Not characteristic for Balint's syndrome.\n\nB. Prion Disease (CJD) - While CJD can cause visual symptoms and rapid progression, it typically presents with more global cognitive decline, myoclonus, and EEG abnormalities. Less typical for isolated parietal-occipital atrophy with preserved memory/language.\n\nC. Alzheimer's Disease pathology - AD commonly presents with posterior cortical atrophy (PCA variant), which causes exactly this clinical picture: visual dysfunction, optic ataxia, simultanagnosia, with relative preservation of memory and language early on. The parietal-occipital predominance is characteristic of PCA, a variant of AD pathology.\n\nD. Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration - Primarily affects frontal and temporal lobes, not parietal-occipital regions. Would present with behavioral/language changes.\n\nE. Vascular Dementia - Would typically show multiple infarcts on imaging, not selective atrophy pattern.\n\nConclusion:\nThe clinical presentation of Balint's syndrome with parietal-occipital atrophy in an elderly patient is most consistent with Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA), which is a variant of Alzheimer's disease pathology.\n\nThe answer is C"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p04-002", "question": "A 3-day-old neonate presents with intractable seizures refractory to phenobarbital, phenytoin, and levetiracetam.

Management follows a stepwise approach:\n\n1. First-line: Beta-blockers (Nadolol or Propranolol) - this patient is already on this\n2. Second-line: Add a Class IC antiarrhythmic (Flecainide) if inadequate response to beta-blockers\n3. Third-line: Consider ICD implantation for high-risk patients or those refractory to medical therapy\n4. Calcium channel blockers: Verapamil has been studied but is NOT standard first-line and may be less effective than flecainide\n\nWhy NOT the other options:\n- A (Switch to Metoprolol): No evidence that switching beta-blockers helps; the issue is inadequate control on beta-blocker monotherapy\n- C (Radiofrequency ablation): CPVT is a generalized disorder of calcium handling, not a focal arrhythmia; ablation is not effective\n- D (Pacemaker): A pacemaker alone doesn't treat the underlying arrhythmia; an ICD would be considered later if medical therapy fails\n- E (Verapamil): While calcium channel blockers have been studied, flecainide is the preferred second-line agent for CPVT\n\nBest Answer:\nThe patient has failed beta-blocker monotherapy and needs escalation. Flecainide is the evidence-based second-line agent for CPVT, particularly for RyR2-mediated disease.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p04-010", "question": "A 32-year-old female presents with amenorrhea and galactorrhea.

Diagnosis is clear: This is a prolactinoma (clinical symptoms + elevated prolactin + imaging findings)\n\n2. Why Option C (Measurement of prolactin in diluted serum)?\n   - This is actually a critical step that's often overlooked\n   - Very high prolactin levels (>200 ng/mL) can cause a \"hook effect\" or falsely low readings in some assays\n   - When prolactin is markedly elevated, diluting the serum and re-measuring ensures accuracy\n   - This is particularly important before making major treatment decisions\n   - The prolactin of 145 ng/mL is elevated but in a range where hook effect could still occur\n\n3. Why not the other options?\n   - Option A (Transsphenoidal resection): While surgery is an option for prolactinomas, medical management with dopamine agonists is typically first-line, even for macroadenomas. Surgery is reserved for cases resistant to medical therapy or with severe complications.\n   - Option B (Stereotactic radiosurgery): Not first-line; reserved for cases resistant to medical and/or surgical therapy\n   - Option D (Octreotide scintigraphy): Used for somatostatin-secreting tumors, not prolactinomas\n   - Option E (Bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling): Used to differentiate pituitary from ectopic ACTH sources in Cushing's syndrome, not relevant here\n\n4. Best Practice: Before initiating treatment for a prolactinoma with very elevated prolactin levels, confirming the prolactin level with diluted serum is the appropriate next step to ensure diagnostic accuracy.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}]
