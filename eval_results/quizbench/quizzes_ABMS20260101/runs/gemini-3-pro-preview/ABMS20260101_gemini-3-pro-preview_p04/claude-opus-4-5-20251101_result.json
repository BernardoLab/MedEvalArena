Switch to Metoprolol Succinate - This would be a step backward. Nadolol is preferred over selective beta-blockers like metoprolol in CPVT because non-selective beta-blockers provide better protection. Studies show nadolol is superior to metoprolol in CPVT.\n\nB. Add Flecainide - Flecainide is the recommended add-on therapy for CPVT patients who have breakthrough arrhythmias despite optimal beta-blocker therapy. Flecainide directly inhibits RyR2 channels and has been shown to reduce arrhythmia burden in CPVT. This is supported by guidelines and clinical evidence.\n\nC. Radiofrequency Ablation - CPVT is not typically amenable to ablation because the arrhythmia substrate is diffuse (related to abnormal calcium handling in cardiomyocytes throughout the heart), not a focal source.\n\nD. Dual-chamber pacemaker - This is not indicated for CPVT. While left cardiac sympathetic denervation (LCSD) might be considered in refractory cases, pacemaker implantation is not a standard treatment.\n\nE. Add Verapamil - While verapamil has some theoretical benefit in calcium handling, it is not the standard second-line agent for CPVT and combining it with beta-blockers can cause significant bradycardia and conduction issues.\n\nThe best next step is to add Flecainide, which is the established second-line therapy for CPVT patients with breakthrough arrhythmias on beta-blocker therapy.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p04-010", "question": "A 32-year-old female presents with amenorrhea and galactorrhea.

This is a laboratory artifact that occurs when extremely high prolactin levels saturate both the capture and detection antibodies in immunometric assays, leading to falsely low reported values.\n\nThe appropriate next step is to measure prolactin in diluted serum (typically 1:100 dilution). If the hook effect is present, the diluted sample will show a much higher prolactin level.\n\nThis distinction is crucial because:\n- If it's truly a giant prolactinoma (confirmed by high prolactin on dilution), medical therapy with dopamine agonists (cabergoline) would be first-line treatment\n- If prolactin is truly only mildly elevated, this may be a non-functioning adenoma causing \"stalk effect\" hyperprolactinemia, which would require surgical management\n\nThe answer is (C)"}]
