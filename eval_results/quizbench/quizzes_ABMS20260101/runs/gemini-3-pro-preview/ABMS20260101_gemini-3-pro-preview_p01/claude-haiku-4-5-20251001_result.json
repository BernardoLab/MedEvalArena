The normal MRI initially doesn't exclude CJD, and the cognitive decline with myoclonus is a classic presentation.\n\nWhy each option:\n- A. Levetiracetam: Used for seizures, but this isn't typical epilepsy (normal EEG, normal MRI, cognitive decline)\n- B. Carbamazepine: Also for seizures; same reasoning as above\n- D. tPA: For acute stroke; no acute stroke presentation here\n- E. Haloperidol: For movement disorders/psychosis; not indicated for myoclonus with cognitive decline\n- C. Intravenous Methylprednisolone: Indicated for autoimmune encephalitis and CJD (particularly when considering potential autoimmune variants). Given the clinical presentation suggestive of CJD with cognitive decline and myoclonus, immunosuppressive therapy is the most appropriate initial treatment while awaiting confirmatory tests (CSF 14-3-3 protein, RT-QuIC, advanced MRI sequences).\n\nThe answer is C"}]
