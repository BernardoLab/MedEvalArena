The vital signs show mild tachycardia (110 bpm) but normal temperature (37.2°C).\n\nKey considerations:\n\nMalignant Hyperthermia (Option A): This involves uncontrolled calcium release via ryanodine receptors, typically triggered by volatile anesthetics and succinylcholine. However, MH presents with hyperthermia, severe metabolic acidosis, and hyperkalemia. The normal temperature here makes this less likely, though early MH is possible.\n\nOption B: This describes prolonged depolarization but doesn't specifically explain the myotonic response.\n\nMyotonic Response (Option C): In myotonic dystrophy, there is abnormal sodium channel function (channelopathy) in the muscle membrane itself. Succinylcholine can trigger a myotonic crisis - a sustained muscle contracture that occurs due to sodium channel hyperexcitability in the muscle fiber membrane (distal to the neuromuscular junction). This is NOT a neuromuscular junction problem but rather an intrinsic muscle membrane abnormality. The myotonic response is characterized by sustained muscle contraction/rigidity that doesn't respond to neuromuscular blocking agents because the problem is in the muscle membrane itself.\n\nOption D: Denervation hypersensitivity with potassium efflux occurs in conditions like burns, spinal cord injury, or prolonged immobilization - not typical for DM1.\n\nOption E: Pseudocholinesterase deficiency causes prolonged paralysis (flaccidity), not rigidity.\n\nThe clinical picture - muscle rigidity after succinylcholine in a patient with myotonic dystrophy, with normal temperature - is classic for a myotonic crisis. This is caused by the underlying sodium channelopathy in DM1, where succinylcholine triggers sustained depolarization and sodium channel hyperexcitability in the muscle membrane itself (not at the NMJ).\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p01-005", "question": "A 45-year-old female with breast cancer is being treated with tamoxifen.

Bowing resolves spontaneously, but 3-4 cm leg length discrepancy persists\n- This is consistent with the natural history of posteromedial bowing. The angular deformity typically corrects spontaneously over the first few years of life, but a significant leg length discrepancy (typically 3-7 cm) often remains and may require treatment.\n\nB. Bowing progresses, requiring osteotomy at age 4\n- This is incorrect. Posteromedial bowing improves spontaneously, not progresses.\n\nC. Pathognomonic for NF1, requires genetic testing\n- This is incorrect. Anterolateral bowing of the tibia is associated with NF1 and risk of pseudarthrosis. Posteromedial bowing is NOT associated with NF1.\n\nD. Bowing resolves but develops rigid clubfoot\n- This is incorrect. The calcaneovalgus foot position (dorsiflexion) associated with posteromedial bowing typically resolves with stretching, not progresses to clubfoot.\n\nE. Tibia will fracture spontaneously (congenital pseudarthrosis)\n- This is incorrect. Congenital pseudarthrosis is associated with anterolateral bowing, not posteromedial bowing. Posteromedial bowing has an excellent prognosis regarding bone integrity.\n\nThe natural history of posteromedial bowing includes:\n1. Spontaneous resolution of the angular deformity\n2. Resolution of the calcaneovalgus foot position\n3.

D-lactic acidosis: Occurs with short bowel syndrome or bacterial overgrowth. No history suggesting this. Also, standard lactate is normal (1.1).\n\nC. Pyroglutamic acidosis (5-oxoproline): Associated with chronic acetaminophen use, malnutrition (glutathione depletion), sepsis, and female gender. Causes high anion gap acidosis with NORMAL osmolar gap. This patient has:\n- Chronic acetaminophen use ✓\n- Severe malnutrition ✓\n- Sepsis ✓\n- Female ✓\n- Normal osmolar gap ✓\n- Normal lactate ✓\n- Negative ketones ✓\n\nD.

Levetiracetam - Standard antiepileptic, but FBDS in autoimmune encephalitis are typically refractory to conventional AEDs\n\nB. Carbamazepine - Another AED, same issue as above\n\nC.
