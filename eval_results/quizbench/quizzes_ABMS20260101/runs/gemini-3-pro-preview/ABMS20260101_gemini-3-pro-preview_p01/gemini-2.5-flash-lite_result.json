The history of hemolysis after ingesting fava beans strongly suggests a diagnosis of Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.\n\nMethemoglobinemia occurs when the iron in hemoglobin is oxidized from the ferrous (Fe2+) to the ferric (Fe3+) state, rendering it unable to bind oxygen. Dapsone is a known cause of acquired methemoglobinemia. G6PD deficiency is a common inherited condition that predisposes individuals to oxidative stress in red blood cells. The enzyme G6PD is critical for the pentose phosphate pathway, which regenerates NADPH. NADPH is essential for reducing oxidized glutathione, which in turn is required by glutathione reductase to reduce methemoglobin back to hemoglobin. In G6PD deficiency, the ability to regenerate NADPH is impaired, making individuals susceptible to oxidative damage and methemoglobin formation when exposed to oxidative stressors like certain drugs (e.g., dapsone) or foods (e.g., fava beans).\n\nThe standard treatment for symptomatic methemoglobinemia is Methylene Blue. Methylene Blue acts as an electron carrier, being reduced by NADPH-dependent flavin reductase to leukomethylene blue, which then efficiently reduces methemoglobin back to hemoglobin. However, methylene blue itself requires NADPH for its action. In patients with G6PD deficiency, the limited supply of NADPH makes methylene blue significantly less effective and can even worsen hemolysis by further taxing the already compromised red blood cells. Therefore, methylene blue is generally considered contraindicated or used with extreme caution in patients with G6PD deficiency.\n\nGiven the strong indication of G6PD deficiency, alternative treatments for methemoglobinemia should be considered. Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) is a chemical reducing agent that can reduce methemoglobin to hemoglobin. While it acts more slowly than methylene blue, it is effective and safe in patients with G6PD deficiency. It is a recommended alternative for mild to moderate methemoglobinemia in G6PD-deficient individuals.\n\nHydroxocobalamin is used for cyanide poisoning.\nHyperbaric oxygen therapy increases dissolved oxygen but does not address the underlying methemoglobinemia.\nSodium thiosulfate is also part of the treatment for cyanide poisoning.\n\nConsidering the patient's symptomatic methemoglobinemia and the contraindication of methylene blue due to suspected G6PD deficiency, ascorbic acid is the most appropriate treatment.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p01-003", "question": "A 31-year-old female presents with amenorrhea 4 months after a full-term delivery.

This abnormal muscle relaxation is caused by instability of the muscle fiber membrane, leading to repetitive muscle action potentials. This phenomenon is essentially muscle hyperexcitability. Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent. In patients with myotonic disorders, succinylcholine can trigger or exacerbate the underlying myotonia, leading to sustained and exaggerated muscle contractions (rigidity) rather than the expected muscle paralysis. This sustained contraction makes ventilation immensely difficult.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\nA. Uncontrolled calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum via the ryanodine receptor: This is the hallmark of Malignant Hyperthermia (MH).

Myotonia is primarily a problem of the muscle fiber membrane distal to the neuromuscular junction.\nC. Exaggerated contracture due to sodium channel hyperexcitability distal to the neuromuscular junction: Myotonia itself is a condition of muscle fiber hyperexcitability leading to delayed relaxation (sustained contracture). Succinylcholine acts as a trigger that causes this pre-existing hyperexcitability to manifest as severe, exaggerated contracture (rigidity). Abnormalities in voltage-gated sodium channels are a common cause of myotonia.\nD. Denervation hypersensitivity leading to massive potassium efflux: Denervation hypersensitivity is relevant in different contexts and does not directly explain the rigidity in myotonic dystrophy after succinylcholine. Massive potassium efflux is a risk with succinylcholine in denervated muscles, leading to hyperkalemia, not primarily rigidity.\nE.

Oral prednisone alone: This treatment improved visual recovery but did not significantly reduce the 2-year risk of developing MS compared to placebo.\nC. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG): IVIG was not part of the original ONTT.\nD. Plasma exchange: Plasma exchange was not part of the original ONTT.\nE. Observation alone (Placebo): This is the control group and would not be expected to increase recurrence.\n\nSince options C and D were not part of the ONTT, they are unlikely answers based on the question's explicit reference to the ONTT. Option E is the placebo and cannot increase recurrence. This leaves options A and B.\n\nGiven the ONTT demonstrated that IVMP treatment (option A) reduced the risk of conversion to MS, while oral prednisone alone (option B) did not, there's a distinction in their ability to modify the underlying disease process. While neither treatment was shown to *increase* optic neuritis recurrence, option B (oral prednisone alone) was less effective than option A in preventing the development of MS, which is a common sequela of demyelinating optic neuritis. If \"recurrence\" were interpreted broadly to include subsequent neurological events related to the underlying demyelinating disease, then oral prednisone alone, by failing to offer the same disease-modifying benefit as IVMP, might be considered a less favorable choice for long-term outcomes concerning future demyelinating events. This is a speculative interpretation, as the ONTT did not support the premise of *increased* recurrence for any treatment. However, in the context of a multiple-choice question where a definitive answer is required, this distinction in preventing MS development is the most significant difference relevant to long-term disease course among the ONTT-tested regimens.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p01-008", "question": "A newborn presents with a unilateral foot deformity where the dorsum of the foot touches the anterior shin.

This constellation of findings, particularly the severe congenital bowing of the tibia, is highly suggestive of congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia (CPT). CPT is characterized by a failure of bone formation leading to a non-union of the tibia, often associated with significant bowing and shortening.\n\nLet's analyze the options in light of CPT:\n\nA. The bowing will spontaneously resolve, but a leg length discrepancy of 3-4 cm will persist.\nSignificant congenital bowing, especially that associated with CPT, does not spontaneously resolve. While leg length discrepancy is a common outcome, spontaneous resolution of the bowing itself is unlikely in such severe cases.\n\nB. The bowing will progress, requiring osteotomy at age 4.\nWhile some bowing can be progressive, the primary concern with CPT is not just progression of bowing but the instability and high risk of fracture. Treatment decisions like osteotomy at a specific age are interventions, not solely the natural history.\n\nC. The condition is pathognomonic for Neurofibromatosis Type 1 and requires genetic testing.\nCongenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia is strongly associated with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1), but it is not pathognomonic for it, meaning it can occur without NF1. While genetic testing for NF1 might be considered in the workup, stating the condition is pathognomonic is incorrect.\n\nD. The bowing will resolve, but the child will develop a rigid clubfoot deformity.\nThe description of the foot deformity (dorsum of the foot touches the anterior shin) is unusual and doesn't fit the typical presentation of a clubfoot (talipes equinovarus), which is characterized by plantarflexion and inversion. Furthermore, significant congenital bowing of the tibia usually does not resolve spontaneously, and the proposed sequence is not consistent with typical outcomes.\n\nE. The tibia will fracture spontaneously within the first year of life (congenital pseudarthrosis).\nThis option directly addresses the most critical and concerning aspect of the natural history of congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia. The weakened bone is prone to spontaneous fractures, often occurring in utero or during early infancy. This risk of fracture and subsequent non-union is the defining characteristic and main cause of morbidity for CPT. The \"congenital pseudarthrosis\" parenthetical accurately describes the underlying pathology leading to this high risk.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate counseling regarding the natural history of a condition presenting with significant congenital tibial bowing, which is likely CPT, centers on the high risk of spontaneous fracture.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{E}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p01-009", "question": "A 55-year-old female is admitted to the ICU with sepsis and severe malnutrition.

The osmolal gap is 295 - 290 = 5 mOsm/kg. A significant osmolal gap (typically >10-20 mOsm/kg) often suggests the presence of unmeasured osmoles like methanol, ethanol, or ethylene glycol.

However, the osmolal gap is small (5 mOsm/kg), making methanol less likely.\nB. D-lactic acidosis: Can cause HAGMA, particularly in patients with malabsorption or short bowel syndrome (which can be a consequence of malnutrition). However, the patient's measured lactate is normal (1.1 mmol/L), making D-lactic acidosis less likely to be the primary cause.\nC. Pyroglutamic acidosis (5-oxoproline accumulation): This typically occurs in critically ill patients with HAGMA, often associated with malnutrition, sepsis, liver disease, renal disease, and certain medications. Chronic acetaminophen use is a significant risk factor because its metabolism leads to glutathione depletion. Glutathione depletion can lead to an accumulation of 5-oxoproline, which is an organic acid. This fits the clinical picture: sepsis, severe malnutrition, history of chronic acetaminophen use, HAGMA, and normal lactate.\nD. Propylene glycol toxicity: Causes HAGMA and an elevated osmolal gap. Propylene glycol is often used as a solvent in IV medications. The small osmolal gap here makes this less likely.\nE. Salicylate toxicity: Can cause a mixed acid-base disorder, including HAGMA. However, the history specifically mentions acetaminophen, not salicylates. While chronic salicylate use can lead to HAGMA, the current evidence points more strongly towards acetaminophen.\n\nConsidering all factors, pyroglutamic acidosis is the most fitting diagnosis given the history of chronic acetaminophen use, severe malnutrition, sepsis, and the presence of HAGMA with a normal lactate and small osmolal gap.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p01-010", "question": "A 68-year-old male presents with a 3-week history of brief, involuntary jerking movements of his right face and arm, occurring up to 40 times per day.
