Crucially, the lesion retains contrast on the hepatobiliary phase of Eovist, and biopsy shows diffuse strong positivity for glutamine synthetase.\n\nThe finding of diffuse strong glutamine synthetase (GS) positivity on biopsy is highly specific for hepatocellular adenoma (HCA). While the MRI findings of T2 hyperintensity and arterial enhancement are nonspecific, the Eovist hepatobiliary phase behavior can be variable in HCAs. Some HCAs, particularly HNF1A-inactivated type, may show retention of contrast due to functional hepatocytes.

The patient's occupation as a tool grinder suggests exposure to airborne dusts.\n\nLet's analyze the potential exposures and their associated lung pathologies:\n\nA.  Silica: Exposure to silica causes silicosis, a pneumoconiosis characterized by fibrosis and nodule formation. Histologically, silicotic nodules contain macrophages and multinucleated giant cells, often with birefringent silica particles within them. While giant cells are present, the term \"cannibalistic\" is not the most characteristic descriptor for them in silicosis.\n\nB.  Asbestos: Asbestos exposure leads to asbestosis, lung cancer, and mesothelioma. Asbestosis involves interstitial fibrosis. Characteristic findings include asbestos bodies (ferruginous bodies). Multinucleated giant cells can be seen, typically reactive to the asbestos fibers.\n\nC.  Cobalt: Cobalt is a component of hard metal alloys (e.g., tungsten carbide-cobalt). Exposure to hard metal dust can cause hard metal lung disease, a form of occupational lung disease. Histologically, it can present with granulomas, interstitial fibrosis, and alveolitis. Multinucleated giant cells are frequently found in hard metal lung disease, often within granulomas or diffusely. Descriptions of these giant cells sometimes mention abundant pale cytoplasm filled with cellular debris, which corresponds well to a \"cannibalistic\" appearance. Since tool grinders often work with carbide tools, cobalt exposure is plausible.\n\nD.  Beryllium: Beryllium exposure causes berylliosis, which can manifest as acute or chronic lung disease. Chronic berylliosis is a granulomatous interstitial lung disease, similar to sarcoidosis. It is characterized by granulomas containing epithelioid cells, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells. These giant cells are phagocytic, but the specific term \"cannibalistic\" is not exclusively or uniquely associated with beryllium disease compared to other conditions.\n\nE.  Coal dust: Exposure to coal dust causes coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP). Histologically, CWP is characterized by coal macules and pigment-laden macrophages. Multinucleated giant cells are not a prominent or characteristic feature of typical CWP.\n\nThe crucial clue here is the description of the multinucleated giant cells as \"cannibalistic,\" meaning they appear to be actively engulfing other cells. While multinucleated giant cells are by nature phagocytic, this specific descriptor suggests a prominent feature. Descriptions of multinucleated giant cells in hard metal lung disease (associated with cobalt exposure) highlight their abundance, large size, abundant cytoplasm, and presence of ingested cellular debris, which aligns well with the term \"cannibalistic.\" Tool grinders frequently work with hard metals, making this a relevant occupational exposure.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p05", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p05-003", "question": "A 29-year-old male who has sex with men presents with severe proctitis, tenesmus, and rectal bleeding.

In neonates with Down syndrome (Trisomy 21), TMD is a preleukemic condition where blasts proliferate. The vast majority of these cases, particularly those with Down syndrome, are associated with somatic mutations in the *GATA1* gene. GATA1 is a transcription factor critical for erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation. Mutations in *GATA1* are found in approximately 90% of TMD cases in infants with Down syndrome and are thought to be the initiating event that drives the proliferation of immature megakaryocytes or their precursors. Importantly, these same *GATA1* mutations are often found in the leukemic blasts if the child later develops acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL), a known complication of TMD in Down syndrome.\n\nLet's consider the other options:\nA.

We need to identify the toxin responsible and its mechanism from the given options.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\nA. Arsenic poisoning can cause neurological symptoms, including weakness and neuropathy, and can lead to multi-organ failure. However, profound hypokalemia is not a characteristic feature of acute arsenic poisoning, and its mechanism involves binding to sulfhydryl groups and uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation.\n\nB. Thallium poisoning causes a characteristic triad of symptoms: neurological defects (including weakness and paralysis), alopecia, and GI disturbances. While thallium can interfere with cellular processes due to its similarity to potassium, leading to cellular dysfunction and neurological symptoms, severe hypokalemia as the primary driver of flaccid paralysis is not its hallmark. Its mechanism is complex but doesn't primarily involve substituting for potassium in ATPase pumps to cause this specific issue.\n\nC. Barium compounds are known rodenticides. Soluble barium salts are toxic and interfere with neuromuscular function by blocking potassium efflux channels in muscle and nerve cells. This blockade leads to an intracellular accumulation of potassium, resulting in significant extracellular hypokalemia. The severe hypokalemia explains the generalized flaccid paralysis, extreme weakness, and the ECG abnormalities (PVCs). This option directly links the toxin, its mechanism, and the clinical presentation.\n\nD. Strychnine is a potent convulsant. It acts by antagonizing glycine receptors in the spinal cord, leading to disinhibition and severe spastic muscle contractions, opisthotonos, and seizures. Flaccid paralysis is the opposite of the muscle tone seen in strychnine poisoning, and hypokalemia is not a primary feature.\n\nE. Sodium monofluoroacetate (Compound 1080) is a highly toxic rodenticide that works by inhibiting the aconitase enzyme in the Krebs cycle, leading to a depletion of metabolic energy (ATP) and accumulation of citrate. It causes significant metabolic derangement, cardiac arrhythmias, and CNS symptoms, but profound hypokalemia causing flaccid paralysis is not its primary mechanism.\n\nBased on the presentation of flaccid paralysis and profound hypokalemia, barium poisoning is the most likely diagnosis.

AFLP is a serious obstetric complication characterized by acute liver failure. While the exact etiology is complex, it is increasingly recognized that AFLP can be precipitated or exacerbated by underlying inherited metabolic disorders in the fetus, particularly defects in fatty acid oxidation (FAO). When the fetus has an FAO defect, it cannot properly metabolize fatty acids for energy. This can lead to accumulation of toxic intermediates that can affect both the fetus and the mother, potentially triggering AFLP.\n\nThe neonate delivered urgently from a mother with AFLP is at risk for metabolic decompensation, especially from underlying inherited metabolic disorders. FAO defects are a common cause of severe hypoglycemia, liver dysfunction, cardiomyopathy, and sudden death in newborns, particularly under metabolic stress such as fasting or illness following birth.\n\nThe plasma acylcarnitine profile is a key biochemical screening test for disorders of amino acid metabolism and fatty acid oxidation. It can detect abnormalities in acylcarnitine levels that are indicative of defects in the beta-oxidation pathway of fatty acids, which are the most relevant inherited metabolic causes of sudden death and liver failure in this context.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA.

FXTAS is a late-onset neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects older male carriers of the FMR1 gene premutation.\n\nThe familial history of a grandson with intellectual disability further supports a link to the *FMR1* gene, as Fragile X syndrome (caused by a full mutation in *FMR1*, typically >200 CGG repeats) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability.\n\nThe range of CGG repeats in the *FMR1* gene is as follows:\n*   Normal: \\<41 CGG repeats\n*   Intermediate: 41-54 CGG repeats\n*   Premutation: 55-200 CGG repeats (associated with FXTAS and increased risk of Fragile X premutation carrier females developing premature ovarian insufficiency)\n*   Full mutation: \\>200 CGG repeats (associated with Fragile X syndrome)\n\nFXTAS is caused by the *premutation* range of CGG repeats (55-200). In this range, the expanded CGG repeats lead to an increase in *FMR1* mRNA transcripts. These transcripts are thought to form toxic RNA foci in the nucleus, leading to neuronal dysfunction and degeneration, particularly in the cerebellum and brainstem, which explains the tremor and ataxia. The protein product of the FMR1 gene is not significantly reduced in FXTAS, unlike in Fragile X syndrome where the gene is silenced.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. CGG repeat expansion > 200: This describes the full mutation, causing Fragile X syndrome (intellectual disability), not FXTAS.\nB. CGG repeat expansion between 55 and 200: This describes the premutation, which is the genetic basis for FXTAS, involving toxic mRNA. This aligns perfectly with the grandfather's symptoms and clinical findings.\nC. CAG repeat expansion: This mechanism is associated with polyglutamine disorders like Huntington's disease and spinocerebellar ataxias, not related to *FMR1* or FXTAS.\nD. CTG repeat expansion: This mechanism is associated with myotonic dystrophy, not *FMR1* or FXTAS.\nE. Deletion of the FMR1 gene: While deletions can cause Fragile X syndrome, FXTAS is linked to *expansions* of CGG repeats, not deletions.\n\nTherefore, the molecular mechanism of the grandfather's condition (FXTAS) is the CGG repeat expansion in the premutation range (55-200) causing mRNA toxicity.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p05", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p05-008", "question": "A 64-year-old male presents with a 1-year history of progressive gait instability, dysarthria, and dysphagia.
