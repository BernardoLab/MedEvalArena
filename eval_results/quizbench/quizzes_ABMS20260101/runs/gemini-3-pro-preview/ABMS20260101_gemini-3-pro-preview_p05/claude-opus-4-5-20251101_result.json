Hepatocellular adenoma (HCA): Associated with OCP use, but typically does NOT retain contrast on hepatobiliary phase (lacks functioning hepatocytes with OATP transporters in most subtypes)\n\n2. Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH): Retains Eovist on hepatobiliary phase due to functioning hepatocytes, but glutamine synthetase shows a characteristic \"map-like\" pattern, not diffuse positivity\n\n3. Hepatocellular adenoma - β-catenin activated subtype: This is the key diagnosis here. The diffuse strong glutamine synthetase positivity is characteristic of β-catenin activated HCA. This subtype can retain Eovist (unlike other adenoma subtypes) because β-catenin activation upregulates OATP expression. This subtype has the highest risk of malignant transformation to hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\nManagement implications:\n\nβ-catenin activated hepatocellular adenomas carry a significant risk of malignant transformation (up to 5-10%), regardless of size or sex. The combination of:\n- Diffuse GS positivity (indicating β-catenin activation)\n- Large size (6 cm)\n- Symptomatic presentation\n\nAll point toward surgical resection as the appropriate management.

Fat malabsorption (steatorrhea)\n2. Neurological symptoms (absent reflexes, ataxia)\n3. Acanthocytes\n4. Very low/absent lipoproteins (especially LDL)\n\nThis is classic for Abetalipoproteinemia.\n\nEvaluating Options:\n\nA. LDL receptor defect - This causes Familial Hypercholesterolemia with HIGH LDL levels, not absent LDL.\n\nB. ABCA1 mutation - This causes Tangier disease, characterized by very low HDL, orange tonsils, and peripheral neuropathy, but LDL is present.\n\nC. MTP deficiency - Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein is essential for assembling apoB-containing lipoproteins (chylomicrons in intestine, VLDL in liver). Deficiency causes abetalipoproteinemia with inability to form chylomicrons and VLDL, leading to absent LDL, fat malabsorption, acanthocytes, and neurological symptoms from fat-soluble vitamin deficiency (especially vitamin E).\n\nD. Lipoprotein lipase deficiency - Causes Type I hyperlipoproteinemia with HIGH triglycerides and chylomicrons.\n\nE. Apolipoprotein C-II deficiency - Also causes hypertriglyceridemia (Type I), not low lipids.\n\nConclusion:\nThe presentation is classic abetalipoproteinemia caused by MTP deficiency. The MTP protein is required for proper assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins. Without it, dietary fats cannot be absorbed properly (causing steatorrhea), and the lack of fat-soluble vitamins (especially vitamin E) causes the neurological manifestations.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}]
