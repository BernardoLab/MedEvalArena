Normal MRI brain\n\nDifferential Diagnosis of Autoimmune Encephalitis with Sleep Disturbances:\n\n- Anti-Hu: Associated with small cell lung cancer, paraneoplastic syndrome with sensory neuropathy, encephalomyelitis. Less specific for sleep disorders.\n\n- Anti-Ma2: Associated with testicular cancer, limbic encephalitis, brainstem involvement. Can cause sleep disturbances but not typically the prominent feature.\n\n- Anti-LGI1: Causes faciobrachial dystonic seizures, temporal lobe epilepsy, hyponatremia. Not typically associated with this constellation.\n\n- Anti-IgLON5: This is the key antibody here. It causes:\n  - Sleep-related hypoventilation and stridor\n  - REM behavior disorder\n  - Insomnia\n  - Gait instability and ataxia\n  - Dysarthria and dysphagia\n  - Brainstem dysfunction\n  - Normal or minimally abnormal MRI (characteristic finding)\n  - Affects both REM and NREM sleep\n\n- Anti-DPPX: Causes encephalitis with prominent seizures, myoclonus, hyperekplexia. Less associated with sleep-specific symptoms.\n\nThe Clinical Pearl: Anti-IgLON5 is uniquely characterized by:\n1. Prominent sleep disturbances (insomnia, REM behavior disorder, sleep apnea)\n2. Brainstem signs (stridor, dysarthria, dysphagia)\n3. Normal or near-normal MRI - this is a distinguishing feature\n4. Affects both REM and NREM sleep architecture\n\nThis case is classic for anti-IgLON5 autoimmune encephalitis.\n\nThe answer is (D)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p05", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p05-009", "question": "A 2-year-old boy presents with eczema, thrombocytopenia, and recurrent pyogenic infections.
