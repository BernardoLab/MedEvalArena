Right calf claudication (exercise-induced leg pain)\n2. Normal ABI at rest, but drops to 0.6 after exercise (functional obstruction)\n3. CT angiography shows normal popliteal artery appearance\n4. Pedal pulses disappear with active plantar flexion (this is the critical finding)\n\nAnalysis:\n\nThe fact that pulses disappear specifically with active plantar flexion is the key diagnostic clue. This indicates that muscle contraction is compressing the popliteal artery.\n\nThe popliteal artery can be compressed by the gastrocnemius muscle during plantar flexion. The different anatomic variants of popliteal artery entrapment syndrome are classified by the relationship between the artery and the gastrocnemius muscle:\n\n- Type I: Medial deviation of the artery (medial to medial head of gastrocnemius)\n- Type II: Abnormal lateral attachment of medial head of gastrocnemius on femur\n- Type III: Accessory slip of medial head of gastrocnemius wraps around the artery - this would compress the artery during muscle contraction\n- Type IV: Artery passes deep to popliteus muscle\n- Type V: Compression by soleus muscle\n\nThe clinical presentation of pulses disappearing with active plantar flexion is most consistent with Type III popliteal artery entrapment, where an accessory muscular slip wraps around the artery. When the gastrocnemius contracts during plantar flexion, this accessory slip compresses the artery, causing the functional obstruction seen on exercise testing.\n\nThe normal appearance on CT angiography at rest is also consistent with this diagnosis, as the compression is dynamic and occurs only with muscle contraction.\n\nThe answer is C"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p02", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p02-010", "question": "A 45-year-old male presents with syncope.
