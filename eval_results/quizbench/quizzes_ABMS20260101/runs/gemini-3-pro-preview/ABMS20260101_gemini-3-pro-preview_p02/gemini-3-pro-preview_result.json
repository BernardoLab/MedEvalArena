Patient Pathology: The patient has a scaphoid waist nonunion. Crucially, there is a \"humpback\" deformity, a DISI (Dorsal Intercalated Segment Instability) pattern, and an increased intrascaphoid angle ($60^\\circ$).\n2.  Humpback Deformity: This occurs when the distal fragment of the scaphoid flexes and the proximal fragment extends (along with the lunate), leading to a collapse of the scaphoid length and carpal instability.\n3.  Treatment Goals: The primary goals are to achieve union AND to correct the deformity. Correcting the deformity requires restoring the length and anatomy of the scaphoid to fix the carpal mechanics (DISI).\n4.  Evaluation of Options:\n    *   A & C (Russe inlay / Matti-Russe): These are inlay grafting techniques. They are effective for achieving union in stable nonunions without significant deformity. However, they rely on packing cancellous bone into a cavity and do *not* provide structural support to distract the fracture, restore length, or correct the angular \"humpback\" deformity.\n    *   B (Vascularized bone graft - 1,2 ICSRA): This is a dorsal vascularized graft typically indicated for proximal pole nonunions or cases with avascular necrosis (AVN). It is technically difficult to correct a volar flexion (humpback) deformity from a dorsal approach, and this specific graft usually does not provide the structural wedge needed for this degree of angular correction.\n    *   E (Proximal row carpectomy): This is a salvage procedure for arthritis (SNAC wrist). This patient is young (22) and has no mention of arthritis, so joint-saving reconstruction is indicated.\n    *   D (Volar wedge interposition graft - Fisk-Fernandez): This technique involves a volar approach where a corticocancellous structural wedge graft (classically from the iliac crest or distal radius) is inserted between the fracture fragments. This acts like a doorstop to open up the collapsed angle, lengthen the scaphoid, and correct the humpback deformity and DISI alignment. Since there is no AVN, a non-vascularized structural graft is appropriate.\n\nConclusion: The Fisk-Fernandez procedure is specifically designed to correct scaphoid nonunions associated with a humpback deformity and carpal instability.\n\nThe answer is (D)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p02", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p02-006", "question": "A 45-year-old female presents with a subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Identify the Pathology: The clinical vignette describes a \"blood blister-like aneurysm\" (BBA). The key features are the patient's presentation with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), an initial negative angiogram (common due to the small size or thrombotic nature initially), and the location on the dorsal (superior) wall of the supraclinoid internal carotid artery (ICA). These lesions are historically distinct from saccular (berry) aneurysms.\n\n2.  Understand the Histology: Unlike saccular aneurysms, which usually occur at branch points and have a distinct neck with a thickened collagen layer, blister aneurysms are essentially focal arterial dissections. They are pseudoaneurysms covered only by a thin layer of adventitia and fibrous tissue. The arterial wall at the base of the lesion is extremely fragile (\"paper-thin\").\n\n3.  Analyze the Surgical Risk: The question asks about the risks of microsurgical clipping. Because BBAs lack a tough, collagenous surgical neck and arise from a fragile section of the arterial wall:\n    *   Standard clips rely on the strength of the aneurysm neck to hold the clip and close the defect.\n    *   When a clip is applied to the base of a blister aneurysm, the closing force of the clip blades often shears through the fragile tissue.\n    *   This leads to the clip tearing the aneurysm off the parent vessel, resulting in avulsion of the ICA wall and catastrophic intraoperative hemorrhage.\n\n4.  Evaluate the Options:\n    *   *A. Ophthalmic artery occlusion* and *D. Anterior choroidal artery infarction* are risks due to the proximity of these vessels (BBAs are often supraclinoid, distal to the ophthalmic and usually proximal to the posterior communicating artery, sometimes near the anterior choroidal). However, these are risks of anatomy, whereas wall avulsion is the specific risk of the *pathology* and the *technique* (clipping).\n    *   *C. Vasospasm* is a general complication of SAH.\n    *   *E. Development of a pseudoaneurysm* describes the nature of the lesion itself or a recurrence risk, but not the immediate intraoperative hazard.\n    *   B. Intraoperative rupture and avulsion of the ICA wall is the widely recognized, specific, and most significant hazard associated with the direct clipping of blister aneurysms.

It is generally negative in thymomas (types A, AB, B1, B2, and B3).\n*   CD117 (c-KIT) positive: CD117 is expressed in about 80% of thymic carcinomas. It is rarely expressed in thymomas (typically <5% of cases). While Seminomas are also CD117 positive, they are CD5 negative.\n*   TdT and CD1a negative: TdT and CD1a are markers for immature T-lymphocytes (thymocytes). Thymomas (B types) are characterized by a neoplastic epithelial component admixed with abundant non-neoplastic immature T-cells that are TdT and CD1a positive. Thymic carcinomas, conversely, lack this population of immature T-cells; any lymphocytes present are usually mature, reactive, and lack these markers. T-cell Lymphoblastic Lymphoma would be TdT positive and usually CD1a positive.\n\nTherefore, the combination of CD5(+) and CD117(+) in the tumor cells, along with the absence of immature T-cell markers, is diagnostic for Thymic Carcinoma.\n\n*   Thymoma (Type B3): Typically CD5(-), CD117(-), and associated with TdT(+) lymphocytes.\n*   T-cell Lymphoblastic Lymphoma: TdT(+), CD1a(+), CD117 usually (-).\n*   Seminoma: CD117(+), but CD5(-).\n*   Mediastinal Large B-cell Lymphoma: CD20(+), CD117(-), CD5(-).\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p02", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p02-009", "question": "A 40-year-old male presents with right calf claudication.

The key clinical features are claudication in a young adult (40-year-old male) and the disappearance of pedal pulses with active plantar flexion of the foot (a specific stress maneuver that tenses the gastrocnemius muscle).\n\nThe classification of PAES generally describes anatomical variations in the relationship between the popliteal artery and the myofascial structures of the popliteal fossa (usually the medial head of the gastrocnemius).\n\n*   Type I: The medial head of the gastrocnemius is in its normal position, but the popliteal artery takes an aberrant path medial to the muscle head. On imaging (angiography/CT), this typically results in a medial deviation of the proximal popliteal artery.\n*   Type II: The medial head of the gastrocnemius attaches laterally (e.g., at the intercondylar notch or lateral condyle) rather than its normal position on the medial condyle. The popliteal artery follows a relatively normal (vertical) course (no medial deviation) but passes medial to this anomalous muscle insertion, leading to entrapment.\n*   Type III: An accessory slip of the medial head of the gastrocnemius wraps around the artery.\n*   Type IV: The popliteal artery passes deep to the popliteus muscle.\n\nThe question states that CT angiography shows a \"normal appearance of the popliteal artery.\" This finding makes Type I unlikely, as Type I is characterized by medial deviation of the vessel. In Type II, the artery runs its normal vertical course but is compressed by the laterally inserted muscle; thus, the resting appearance of the artery's course is often normal (or straight), fitting the description in the question (unlike the deviated course in Type I).\n\nWhile Type III also involves a normal arterial course, the distinction between Type I (deviated) and Type II (not deviated/straight) is a classic board examination topic. The description in Option B matches the anatomical definition of Type II PAES. Option E (Cystic degeneration) is unlikely given the normal appearance on CT (which would likely visualize the cyst) and the specific pulse loss with plantar flexion.\n\nTherefore, the most likely anatomic variant responsible, consistent with a normal angiographic appearance (lack of deviation), is Type II.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p02", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_gemini-3-pro-preview_p02-010", "question": "A 45-year-old male presents with syncope.

Risk Stratification in *LMNA* Cardiomyopathy: *LMNA* mutations are associated with a high rate of malignant ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD), as well as progressive conduction system disease. The risk of SCD is often independent of the severity of LV dysfunction compared to other dilated cardiomyopathies.\n2.  Indications for ICD:\n    *   According to the 2019 HRS Expert Consensus Statement on Catheter Ablation of Ventricular Arrhythmias and the 2022 ESC Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Ventricular Arrhythmias and the Prevention of Sudden Cardiac Death, patients with *LMNA* mutations are candidates for early ICD implantation based on risk factors.\n    *   Common risk factors justifying ICD implantation in *LMNA* carriers include: LVEF < 45%, male sex, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), and non-missense (truncating) mutations.\n    *   This patient has at least two major risk factors: Male sex and LVEF 42% (<45%).\n3.  Management of Syncope and Conduction Disease: The patient has syncope and evidence of conduction system disease (1st-degree AV block + RBBB). In *LMNA* patients, conduction disease progresses rapidly to complete heart block. Syncope in this context is alarming for either paroxysmal AV block or ventricular tachyarrhythmia.\n    *   While a pacemaker (Option A) would treat bradycardia caused by heart block, it offers no protection against the high risk of SCD from ventricular arrhythmias inherent to *LMNA* cardiomyopathy with reduced EF.\n    *   Therefore, an ICD (which has pacing capabilities) is the recommended device to manage both the conduction disease and the risk of sudden death.\n4.  Why not other options?\n    *   Loop recorder (C): The patient is high-risk with a known genetic substrate and demonstrated structural/conduction abnormalities. Diagnostic monitoring delays life-saving therapy.\n    *   Amiodarone (D): Not the first-line prevention for SCD in this context and does not address the potential need for pacing.\n    *   Metoprolol/Reassessment (E): While beta-blockers are part of HF management, the \"wait and see\" approach (waiting 3 months for remodeling) used in general heart failure is generally superseded by the specific high-risk nature of *LMNA* mutations, especially in a male patient with syncope and conduction/structural defects. The risk of SCD is immediate.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate management is the implantation of an ICD.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}]
