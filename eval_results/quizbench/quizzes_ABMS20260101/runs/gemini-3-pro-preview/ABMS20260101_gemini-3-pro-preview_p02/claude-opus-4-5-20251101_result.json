This leads to DISI pattern where the lunate extends dorsally. The increased intrascaphoid angle (60 degrees) confirms significant angular deformity that needs correction.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n\nA. Russe inlay bone graft - This is a corticocancellous inlay graft that fills the defect but doesn't specifically address angular deformity correction.\n\nB. Vascularized bone graft (1,2 ICSRA) - Indicated primarily when there IS avascular necrosis. Since AVN is absent here, this is not the primary indication.\n\nC. Matti-Russe procedure - This involves excavating the scaphoid and packing with cancellous bone. It doesn't correct angular deformity well.\n\nD. Volar wedge interposition graft (Fisk-Fernandez) - This technique specifically addresses the humpback deformity by inserting a wedge-shaped (trapezoidal) corticocancellous graft from the iliac crest through a volar approach. The wedge shape corrects the angular deformity and restores scaphoid length and carpal alignment.\n\nE.

Thymoma (Type B3):\n- Thymomas are typically positive for CD5 and CD117\n- However, thymomas usually have immature T-cells that are TdT+ and CD1a+\n- Type B3 thymoma is not typically described as \"high-grade malignancy\"\n\nB.
