In this setting, a permanent medialization procedure is appropriate.  \n\nAmong the options:  \n\n- **A) Hyaluronic acid gel** is temporary (typically 3–6 months), not optimal for a permanent problem.  \n- **B) Calcium hydroxylapatite** provides longer-term (but not always truly “permanent”) augmentation, often used in vocal fold paralysis with reasonable longevity.  \n- **C) Autologous fat** can offer long-term correction, but resorption can be variable and may require overinjection; not all fat survives.  \n- **D) Gelfoam** is very short-term (weeks), not appropriate for 6-month-old paralysis.  \n- **E) Polydimethylsiloxane** (PDMS, e.g., “Voice Gel” or “Vox” implants) is intended as a permanent, irreversible implant material for injection laryngoplasty.  \n\nGiven the EMG suggests no recovery expected, a **permanent irreversible implant** is a standard definitive choice. Among permanent options, calcium hydroxylapatite is often used, but polydimethylsiloxane is specifically designed as a permanent, irreversible material for injection medialization in such cases, whereas calcium hydroxylapatite can sometimes degrade over years.  \n\nIn clinical practice guidelines for unilateral vocal fold paralysis with poor prognosis for recovery, permanent injectables like calcium hydroxylapatite or PDMS are both acceptable, but PDMS is described as permanent and irreversible, while calcium hydroxylapatite is considered long-lasting but not necessarily irreversible. Some sources recommend PDMS for permanent paralysis when recovery is not expected.  \n\nHowever, the question asks for the **optimal** injection material in this scenario. With EMG showing absent MUPs, a permanent solution is warranted. Both B and E are permanent, but E is explicitly “permanent irreversible,” which may be optimal if reinnervation is impossible. **Autologous fat** (C) is also a possible long-term option but tends to have variable survival and is often better for volume restoration in atrophy, while here the priority is durable medialization for aspiration prevention.  \n\nMany experts would choose **calcium hydroxylapatite** for its balance of permanence and safety, but the question's phrasing (“permanent irreversible” in option E) matches a definitive, no-recovery-needed scenario. Still, clinical practice patterns often favor calcium hydroxylapatite over PDMS for injection laryngoplasty in this setting.  \n\nGiven typical board-style answers, **calcium hydroxylapatite** (B) is often selected over PDMS because of common use and FDA approval for vocal fold paralysis, even though PDMS is also permanent.  \n\nBut if we strictly match “optimal” for irreversible paralysis with no recovery on EMG, PDMS could be argued.
