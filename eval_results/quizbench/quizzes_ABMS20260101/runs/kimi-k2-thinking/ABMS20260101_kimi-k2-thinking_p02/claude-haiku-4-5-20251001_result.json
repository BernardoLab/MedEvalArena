This occurs because DRESS involves immune dysregulation that allows latent herpesvirus reactivation.\n\nEvaluating Each Option:\n\nA. Confirms phenytoin as the causative drug\n- HHV-6 reactivation is a consequence of DRESS, not confirmation of the drug cause. The clinical presentation and timeline already confirm phenytoin.\n\nB. Indicates need for ganciclovir antiviral therapy\n- HHV-6 reactivation in DRESS is typically self-limited and doesn't routinely require antiviral therapy. Treatment focuses on stopping the offending drug and corticosteroids.\n\nC. Predicts higher risk of disease flare and organ damage\n- This is correct. HHV-6 reactivation in DRESS is associated with more severe disease, increased risk of flares, and greater organ involvement (hepatic, renal, hematologic complications).\n\nD. Represents asymptomatic viral reactivation without prognostic value\n- Incorrect - HHV-6 reactivation in DRESS DOES have prognostic significance.\n\nE. Suggests alternative diagnosis of acute HHV-6 infection\n- Incorrect - the clinical picture is classic DRESS, not primary HHV-6 infection.

Maintain low-dose corticosteroids for graft protection\n\nAnalysis of Options:\n\nA.

Reduce mycophenolate mofetil by 50% - Partial reduction, but insufficient\n\nC. Switch tacrolimus to cyclosporine - Not indicated; both are calcineurin inhibitors with similar immunosuppressive effects\n\nD. Discontinue mycophenolate mofetil completely - CORRECT. MMF is the most potent immunosuppressive agent in this regimen and is the first agent to reduce/eliminate in BKVN management. This allows immune reconstitution to control BK virus while maintaining tacrolimus and prednisone for graft protection.\n\nE.
