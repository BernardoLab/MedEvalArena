Patient has good performance status\n\nLet me analyze each option:\n\nOption A: 70 Gy in 35 fractions over 7 weeks with concurrent cisplatin\n- Standard fractionation with chemotherapy\n- For T2N0 glottic cancer, concurrent chemotherapy is not typically indicated as it doesn't improve outcomes but adds toxicity\n\nOption B: 66 Gy in 33 fractions over 6.5 weeks with concurrent cetuximab\n- Adding cetuximab to early glottic cancer is not standard practice\n- Dose is also slightly lower\n\nOption C: 72 Gy in 42 fractions using concomitant boost over 6 weeks\n- This is an accelerated fractionation scheme (concomitant boost)\n- Delivers higher total dose in shorter overall treatment time\n- Addresses tumor repopulation which is important in head and neck cancers\n- Studies (like RTOG 90-03) showed improved local control with accelerated fractionation for head and neck cancers\n\nOption D: 60 Gy in 30 fractions over 6 weeks with hyperfractionation\n- 60 Gy is too low for definitive treatment\n- True hyperfractionation uses smaller doses twice daily with higher total dose\n\nOption E: 50 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks with hypofractionation\n- 50 Gy is inadequate for definitive treatment of T2 glottic cancer\n\nFor T2 glottic carcinoma, especially with anterior commissure involvement (which has higher failure rates), accelerated fractionation has been shown to improve local control. The concomitant boost technique delivers 72 Gy in 6 weeks, which addresses the issue of accelerated tumor repopulation and provides adequate dose intensity.\n\nFor early glottic cancer (T1-T2 N0), chemotherapy is not routinely added as it increases toxicity without clear benefit. Altered fractionation (accelerated or hyperfractionated) has shown improved local control in randomized trials.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p02", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p02-008", "question": "A 68-year-old man is 18 days post-Ivor Lewis esophagectomy with gastric conduit reconstruction for stage III esophageal adenocarcinoma.

Patient is septic with mediastinitis - this is life-threatening\n2. The fistula is at the carina level (central airway)\n3. 18 days post-op - tissues are in the inflammatory phase, not ideal for primary repair\n4. 5mm fistula is relatively small but causing significant contamination\n\nAnalyzing options:\n\nA) Endoscopic stenting (esophageal + airway): This is increasingly used as a bridge or definitive therapy for anastomotic leaks and fistulas. Dual stenting can seal the fistula, control sepsis, and allow healing. However, for a gastrobronchial fistula with active sepsis, this may not provide adequate source control.\n\nB) Emergency thoracotomy with fistula repair, intercostal muscle flap, conduit resection, cervical esophagostomy: This is the most aggressive surgical approach - addresses the fistula directly, provides vascularized tissue coverage, removes the contaminated conduit, and creates diversion. This is definitive management for a septic patient with mediastinitis.\n\nC) Conservative management (NPO, TPN, antibiotics): Unlikely to work for an established fistula with sepsis and mediastinitis. This is not definitive.\n\nD) Fibrin glue: Too conservative for a 5mm fistula with sepsis.\n\nE) Cervical esophagostomy and conduit abandonment WITHOUT fistula repair: This doesn't address the ongoing contamination from the fistula itself.\n\nDecision:\nGiven the sepsis, mediastinitis, and established fistula, the patient needs definitive surgical intervention.

Also, in pre-excited AF, AV nodal blocking agents should be avoided, and while flecainide can slow accessory pathway conduction, it's not appropriate here given the structural heart disease.\n\nB) Catheter ablation - While typically first-line for WPW with symptomatic arrhythmias, in Danon disease, multiple accessory pathways are common and often recur after ablation. The success rate is lower, and new pathways can develop. Additionally, with severe HCM and ongoing symptoms, this may not address the underlying progressive cardiomyopathy.\n\nC) Increase beta-blocker - Already on maximal medical therapy, and beta-blockers alone won't prevent rapid conduction through accessory pathways in AF.\n\nD) Heart transplantation evaluation - Given Danon disease in a male with severe HCM (28mm septum), recurrent syncope (suggesting high arrhythmic risk), multiple accessory pathways, and refractory symptoms despite maximal therapy, transplant evaluation is appropriate.
