This causes autonomous, gonadotropin-independent hormone production. In girls, this results in autonomous ovarian estrogen production - the ovaries produce estrogen WITHOUT stimulation from pituitary gonadotropins (LH/FSH).\n\nKey point: This is peripheral/gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty, NOT central precocious puberty.\n\nEvaluating each option:\n\nA. GnRH agonist (leuprolide) - This works by suppressing pituitary gonadotropin release. However, in MAS, the ovaries are producing estrogen autonomously, independent of gonadotropins. GnRH agonists would NOT be effective because the problem isn't central - it's peripheral autonomous hormone production.\n\nB. Aromatase inhibitor (letrozole) - Aromatase inhibitors block the conversion of androgens to estrogens. This directly targets the excess estrogen production that is occurring autonomously in the ovaries. This addresses the underlying pathophysiology of autonomous estrogen synthesis.\n\nC. Estrogen receptor antagonist (tamoxifen) - This blocks estrogen action at the receptor level but doesn't address the source of excess estrogen production.\n\nD. Progesterone-only contraceptive - This doesn't address the autonomous estrogen production.\n\nE. Ketoconazole - This inhibits steroidogenesis but is not the first-line or most specific treatment for this condition.\n\nBest answer: Aromatase inhibitors like letrozole specifically target the autonomous estrogen production by blocking the enzyme that converts androgens to estrogens.

Left ventricular dilation - This is a common finding in ALCAPA due to ischemia and heart failure, but it's nonspecific and can occur in many conditions causing heart failure.\n\nB. Papillary muscle dysfunction - This explains the mitral regurgitation mentioned and is common in ALCAPA due to ischemia, but it's not pathognomonic as it can occur in other conditions.\n\nC. Septal wall motion abnormalities - Can occur with ischemia but is nonspecific.\n\nD. Coronary artery collaterals with 'seagull' sign - The \"seagull sign\" refers to the appearance on echocardiography where dilated collateral vessels connecting the right and left coronary systems create a characteristic pattern. This is quite specific for ALCAPA.\n\nE. Right coronary artery dilation - In ALCAPA, the right coronary artery becomes dilated because it supplies collateral flow to the left coronary territory. The blood then flows retrograde through the left coronary artery into the low-pressure pulmonary artery (coronary steal). This dilated RCA is a characteristic and pathognomonic finding for ALCAPA.\n\nThe pathognomonic findings in ALCAPA include:\n- Dilated right coronary artery (compensatory)\n- Retrograde flow in the left coronary artery\n- Connection of LCA to pulmonary artery\n\nThe right coronary artery dilation is particularly pathognomonic because it represents the compensatory mechanism where the RCA dilates to provide collateral flow to the LCA territory. This finding, combined with the retrograde flow already mentioned, is highly specific for ALCAPA.\n\nThe answer is (E)"}]
