Ketotifen has both H1-antihistamine and mast cell-stabilizing properties and is used in mast cell disorders.  \n\nIncreasing omalizumab dose (A) is sometimes done, but HαT may respond less predictably, and ketotifen is a more specific next step in mast cell activation before escalating biologics.  \nProphylactic prednisone (B) is not ideal long-term.  \nCromolyn (C) is more for GI and cutaneous symptoms but less potent for systemic anaphylaxis prevention.  \nAllergen immunotherapy (E) is not indicated here as her anaphylaxis is idiopathic, not triggered by specific allergens.  \n\nThe best next therapy among the options is ketotifen.  \n\nThe answer is (D)"}]
