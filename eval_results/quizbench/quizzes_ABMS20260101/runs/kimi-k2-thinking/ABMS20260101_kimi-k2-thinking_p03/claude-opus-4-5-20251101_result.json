Hemangiopericytoma is a well-known cause.\n\nMechanism: Big IGF-2 activates insulin receptors, causing hypoglycemia with suppressed insulin and C-peptide.\n\nTreatment Options Analysis:\n\nA. Hydrocortisone - Glucocorticoids are actually first-line treatment for NICTH. They work by:\n   - Decreasing IGF-2 production\n   - Increasing hepatic glucose output\n   - Antagonizing peripheral glucose uptake\n   - Can work rapidly within hours to days\n\nB. Recombinant IGF-1 - This would worsen hypoglycemia by activating insulin receptors further. Contraindicated.\n\nC. Diazoxide - Works by inhibiting insulin secretion. Since insulin is already suppressed (<2), this won't help in NICTH.\n\nD. Octreotide - Inhibits insulin and growth hormone secretion. Not effective when insulin is already suppressed. Used for insulinoma, not NICTH.\n\nE. Glucagon - Provides temporary glucose elevation but has short duration, causes tachyphylaxis, and won't address the underlying mechanism effectively for sustained control.\n\nBest Answer: Glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone) are the established first-line pharmacologic treatment for NICTH when dextrose infusion is insufficient.

However, with no pancreatic lesions, this seems overly aggressive.\n\nB) Pancreas-preserving duodenectomy with regional lymphadenectomy: This addresses the duodenal tumor and lymph node metastases while preserving the pancreas (which is uninvolved).

It's used for GI symptoms in mastocytosis but has limited systemic absorption.\n\nD) Ketotifen - This is a mast cell stabilizer with antihistamine properties. It has both H1-blocking activity and mast cell stabilizing effects. Ketotifen is often used in mast cell activation disorders and hereditary α-tryptasemia when antihistamines alone are insufficient. It can cross the blood-brain barrier and has systemic effects.\n\nE) Allergen immunotherapy - This patient has \"idiopathic\" anaphylaxis, meaning no specific allergen trigger has been identified. Immunotherapy requires identified allergens and could potentially be dangerous in someone with mast cell instability.\n\nFor hereditary α-tryptasemia with persistent symptoms despite antihistamines and omalizumab, adding a mast cell stabilizer like ketotifen is a reasonable next step. Ketotifen has dual action as both an antihistamine and mast cell stabilizer, making it particularly useful in mast cell disorders.\n\nThe answer is (D)"}]
