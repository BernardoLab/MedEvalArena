The laboratory findings of low insulin, low C-peptide, markedly elevated IGF-2, and an elevated IGF-2:IGF-1 ratio are classic for non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia (NICTH), where the tumor (in this case, metastatic hemangiopericytoma) is producing IGF-2. IGF-2 is a potent hypoglycemic agent that mimics the actions of insulin by increasing glucose uptake and suppressing hepatic glucose production.\n\nWe need to select the immediate pharmacologic intervention most likely to achieve euglycemia within 24 hours. Let's analyze the options:\n\nA. Continuous hydrocortisone infusion 10 mg/hour: Glucocorticoids are a cornerstone of medical management for NICTH. They promote hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, thereby increasing glucose production to counteract hypoglycemia. They may also, in some cases, suppress the production of IGF-2 by the tumor. A continuous infusion ensures a sustained effect.\n\nB. Recombinant IGF-1 40 mg subcutaneously twice daily: This is contraindicated. Administering exogenous IGF-1 would exacerbate the patient's hypoglycemia, which is already driven by elevated endogenous IGF-2.\n\nC. Diazoxide 300 mg orally three times daily: Diazoxide is primarily used for hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (e.g., insulinoma) as it inhibits insulin secretion. Since this patient has low insulin and C-peptide levels, diazoxide would be ineffective.\n\nD. Octreotide 200 μg subcutaneously three times daily: Octreotide is a somatostatin analog that can inhibit the release of various hormones, including growth hormone and potentially IGF-2. While it can be effective in some cases of tumor-related hypoglycemia, its efficacy in IGF-2 mediated hypoglycemia is variable and often less pronounced than that of glucocorticoids.\n\nE. Glucagon 2 mg intramuscularly every 4 hours: Glucagon stimulates hepatic glucose production and can raise blood glucose levels. However, it is typically given intermittently or as a continuous infusion. Given that a high-dose continuous intravenous dextrose infusion is currently failing to maintain euglycemia, intermittent glucagon injections may not be sufficient to overcome the profound hypoglycemic drive from IGF-2, which can also suppress hepatic glucose output.\n\nConsidering the mechanism of hypoglycemia (IGF-2 excess) and the need for rapid, sustained euglycemia, hydrocortisone is the most appropriate immediate intervention among the given options. It addresses the glucose deficit directly by stimulating glucose production and may modulate the underlying cause.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p03", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p03-002", "question": "A 42-year-old man with MEN1 syndrome (germline MEN1 c.628_631del) is found to have a 2.8 cm duodenal gastrinoma with 3 regional periduodenal lymph node metastases on Ga-68 DOTATATE PET/CT.

Surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment for resectable gastrinomas to achieve cure and manage ZES, especially in MEN1 patients where it can be curative.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. Whipple pancreaticoduodenectomy with pylorus preservation: This is a major operation typically indicated for tumors involving the head of the pancreas, distal common bile duct, or periampullary region. While it can resect duodenal tumors, it is usually reserved for cases with ampullary or pancreatic involvement, which is not explicitly stated here, and the option notes \"no pancreatic lesions.\"\n\nB. Pancreas-preserving duodenectomy with regional lymphadenectomy: This surgical approach specifically targets the duodenal tumor and the surrounding lymph nodes metastasis. Given that the tumor is described as a \"duodenal gastrinoma\" and there are \"no pancreatic lesions,\" preserving the pancreas is desirable to minimize morbidity. A regional lymphadenectomy is crucial as the patient has documented lymph node metastases. This option is tailored to resecting the duodenal tumor and nodal disease while avoiding pancreatic resection, which is appropriate for a localized duodenal primary neoplasm outside the periampullary region.\n\nC. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) of the duodenal tumor: ESD is suitable for small, superficial, early-stage lesions confined to the mucosa. A 2.8 cm tumor with regional lymph node metastases is too advanced for ESD alone and requires surgical resection with a wider margin and lymphadenectomy.\n\nD. Long-acting octreotide 30 mg monthly without surgery: While somatostatin analogs help control hormone secretion and tumor growth, they are generally not curative for localized, potentially resectable tumors with metastatic potential. Surgery is preferred for the possibility of cure in such cases.\n\nE. Tumor enucleation through duodenotomy only: Enucleation, especially for smaller lesions, can be an option. However, for a 2.8 cm tumor with documented lymph node metastases, simple enucleation might not achieve adequate oncological clearance with sufficient margins and is less comprehensive than a formal duodenal resection with lymphadenectomy.\n\nConsidering the size of the tumor (2.8 cm) and the presence of regional lymph node metastases, a significant resection is required. The absence of pancreatic lesions points towards a tumor primarily within the duodenal wall, making a pancreas-preserving duodenectomy with regional lymphadenectomy the most appropriate surgical choice to achieve complete tumor removal and regional control while minimizing pancreatic exocrine and endocrine insufficiency. If the tumor were located at or very close to the ampulla of Vater, a Whipple procedure might be considered, but the description does not suggest this.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p03", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p03-003", "question": "A 59-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate develops progressive dyspnea and weight loss.

However, mucin-filled cysts are not a typical or defining feature of UIP. While rheumatoid lung disease can sometimes manifest with honeycombing, the biopsy description does not explicitly mention mucin-filled cysts, making this less likely to be the *most* differentiating finding based on the text.\n*   C.

This strongly suggests recurrent or de novo atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) affecting the graft. Eculizumab, a C5 complement inhibitor, was started preemptively to prevent or treat aHUS.\n\nDespite eculizumab treatment, the patient's condition is progressing, with rising creatinine, indicating a lack of adequate therapeutic effect. The goal of eculizumab therapy in aHUS is to inhibit the complement cascade by binding to C5, preventing its cleavage into C5a and C5b, thereby halting the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC).\n\nThe fact that TMA is progressing while the patient is on eculizumab raises concerns about the adequacy of the current therapeutic regimen. Several possibilities exist:\n1.  Sub-therapeutic eculizumab levels: The dose of 900 mg weekly might not be sufficient for this specific patient, possibly due to increased complement activation load or pharmacokinetic variations.\n2.  Inadequate complement inhibition: Even if drug levels are within a typical range, they might not be sufficient to fully suppress complement pathway activation downstream of C5.\n3.  Other contributing factors: While aHUS is the primary concern, other causes of TMA post-transplant (e.g., antibody-mediated rejection, drug toxicity) could be playing a role, although the CFH mutation makes aHUS highly probable.\n\nBefore altering the treatment strategy (e.g., increasing dose, switching medication, or initiating plasma exchange), it is crucial to assess the efficacy of the current therapy. Measuring the eculizumab trough level will reveal the drug concentration in the patient's bloodstream. Concurrently, measuring CH50 activity (which assesses the integrity of the classical and lectin complement pathways through the terminal pathway up to C8) or other complement cascade markers can indicate the functional impact of eculizumab on complement activation. Adequate eculizumab therapy should lead to profound suppression of CH50 activity.\n\nIf eculizumab trough levels are insufficient or CH50 activity is not adequately suppressed, it directly supports the need for a dose adjustment or a change in therapy.\n*   Increasing the eculizumab dose to 1,200 mg weekly (Option A) is a possible subsequent step if trough levels are suboptimal.\n*   Switching to ravulizumab (Option C), a longer-acting C5 inhibitor, is another possibility if eculizumab fails or is difficult to manage.\n*   Initiating daily plasma exchange (Option B) is an alternative or adjunctive therapy for TMA but is typically considered if targeted therapy is ineffective or unavailable.\n*   Proceeding with transplant nephrectomy (Option E) is a last resort and premature at this stage.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate *next step* is to gather diagnostic information to understand why the current eculizumab therapy is failing.

The reduced ADAMTS13 activity (45%) further supports a diagnosis of TMA, although it's higher than typically seen in classic TTP (<10%).\n\nTA-TMA is a serious complication that arises from endothelial damage, leading to microvascular thrombosis. Common triggers in the post-transplant setting include calcineurin inhibitors (like tacrolimus, which was recently stopped for rising creatinine), immunosuppression, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and other insults to the endothelium.\n\nLet's evaluate the treatment options:\n\nA. Eculizumab is a C5 complement inhibitor. While complement activation can be involved in some forms of TMA (like atypical HUS), it is not the first-line treatment for TA-TMA unless a strong complement-mediated component is clearly identified.\n\nB. High-dose methylprednisolone (1 g IV x3 days) plus plasma exchange (PEX) is a common and aggressive initial therapeutic strategy for TA-TMA, especially when there is significant organ involvement (renal in this case, as evidenced by proteinuria). Plasma exchange helps remove pro-thrombotic factors, microthrombi, and potentially autoantibodies. High-dose corticosteroids aim to suppress the underlying endothelial inflammation and immune dysregulation contributing to TMA, and can also be helpful if there's an overlap with GVHD.\n\nC. Rituximab is a CD20-targeted B-cell depleting agent. It is effective in immune-mediated conditions, particularly those with autoantibodies. While it may have a role in refractory TA-TMA or specific types of TMA, it is not typically the first-line therapy for TA-TMA itself unless a strong autoimmune etiology (like antibody-mediated TTP) is suspected, which is less clear here given the ADAMTS13 level.\n\nD.

High-dose prednisone: Corticosteroids are often used for initial management of autoinflammatory diseases, but due to significant long-term side effects and potential for insufficient control in severe or refractory cases, they are not typically the *next* step after failure of potent biologic therapies like IL-1 inhibitors in an ongoing chronic condition.\nB.

Several studies and case reports highlight successful use of baricitinib in CANDLE syndrome.\nC. Tocilizumab: This is an IL-6 receptor antagonist. IL-6 is elevated in CANDLE syndrome, and tocilizumab has demonstrated effectiveness in patients who have failed other treatments, including IL-1 inhibitors. It is a valid option.\nD.

Allogeneic stem cell transplant (ASCT): This is a potentially curative but high-risk procedure, typically reserved for the most severe, life-threatening, or refractory cases where other treatments have failed and the disease burden is substantial. It would likely be considered after other advanced medical therapies have been exhausted.\n\nComparing Options B and C, both baricitinib and tocilizumab are considered appropriate next steps after IL-1 blockade failure in CANDLE syndrome. However, given that PSMB8 mutations are strongly associated with aberrant type I interferon signaling, and JAK inhibitors like baricitinib effectively block these pathways in addition to IL-6 signaling, baricitinib may offer a broader or more targeted therapeutic effect in this specific genetic subset of CANDLE syndrome when IL-1 blockade fails.

DADA2 is a monogenic autoinflammatory disorder characterized by systemic inflammation affecting blood vessels, bone marrow, and other organs.\n\nTreatment for DADA2 aims to control the underlying systemic inflammation. Let's evaluate the given options:\n\nA. High-dose systemic glucocorticoids are often used for initial control of inflammation in many vasculitic and autoinflammatory conditions. However, they are associated with significant long-term side effects and are not typically curative or the most effective long-term management strategy for DADA2.\n\nB.

While TNF-alpha is involved in inflammation, studies and clinical practice have shown variable and often limited efficacy of TNF inhibitors in DADA2 compared to other agents.\n\nD. Anakinra is an interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist. The IL-1 pathway is a key mediator of inflammation in many autoinflammatory diseases. Anakinra has demonstrated significant efficacy in controlling the systemic inflammation, fevers, vasculitic manifestations, and neurological events characteristic of DADA2. It is widely regarded as a highly effective therapy for this condition, often showing rapid and sustained improvement.\n\nE. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody targeting CD20-expressing B cells.

The skin biopsy description, \"intracellular yeast forms with central septation,\" is somewhat atypical but can be seen in various mycoses; however, the underlying immune defect is key.\n\nAnalysis of treatment options:\nA.

Itraconazole is effective maintenance therapy for many endemic mycoses like histoplasmosis and paracoccidioidomycosis. Crucially, ruxolitinib is a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor. STAT1 GOF leads to hyperactivation of the STAT1 pathway. Inhibiting JAKs, which are upstream regulators of STAT1, is the targeted therapy to manage the immune dysregulation caused by STAT1 GOF. This option provides comprehensive management by treating the acute infection, offering appropriate maintenance, and addressing the specific immunodeficiency.\nD. Caspofungin is an echinocandin.

Six watery stools daily usually falls into Grade 2 or 3 diarrhea. AST/ALT elevated between 3x and 5x the upper limit of normal (ULN) is classified as Grade 2 hepatitis.\n\nAccording to established guidelines for managing irAEs:\n*   For Grade 2 irAEs, the recommended management typically involves holding the immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and initiating symptomatic treatment or low-dose corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone 0.5-1 mg/kg/day for GI, or 0.5-1 mg/kg/day for liver if Grade 2).\n*   For Grade 3/4 irAEs, permanent discontinuation of ICIs is usually recommended, followed by high-dose corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone 1-2 mg/kg/day).

Symptoms persist despite high-dose cetirizine and omalizumab. The underlying issue is likely related to mast cell activation and mediator release, potentially exacerbated by alpha-tryptasemia.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. Increasing omalizumab to 600 mg monthly: Omalizumab targets IgE. While it's used for chronic spontaneous urticaria, its effectiveness in idiopathic anaphylaxis and general mast cell stabilization is limited when IgE is not the predominant driver. Doubling the dose might be considered for severe CSU, but it may not address the broader mast cell activation issue contributing to anaphylaxis and refractory symptoms.\n\nB. Prophylactic prednisone 10 mg daily: Systemic corticosteroids are potent anti-inflammatory and mast cell stabilizing agents. However, long-term daily use of prednisone, even at a low dose, carries significant risks of side effects. It is typically reserved for severe, refractory cases or acute flares, and usually not the first-line next step after failing antihistamines and omalizumab in chronic management.\n\nC. Cromolyn sodium 200 mg QID: Cromolyn sodium is a mast cell stabilizer. It inhibits the release of chemical mediators from mast cells and basophils. It is well-established in the management of mast cell activation disorders, mastocytosis, and can be effective for various symptoms related to mast cell degranulation, including anaphylaxis and urticaria. Given the patient's refractory symptoms, alpha-tryptasemia, and history of anaphylaxis, directly targeting mast cell stabilization is a logical next therapeutic step.\n\nD. Ketotifen 2 mg BID (mast cell stabilizer): Ketotifen is a dual-acting medication, working as both an H1-antihistamine and a mast cell stabilizer. It is often used in allergic conditions and may be beneficial for mast cell activation symptoms. However, the patient is already on high-dose cetirizine. If the persistence of symptoms is due to uncontrolled mast cell mediator release beyond what high-dose antihistamines and omalizumab can control, a pure mast cell stabilizer like cromolyn sodium might be a more targeted approach than adding another agent with antihistaminic properties, although ketotifen's mast cell stabilizing component could be beneficial.\n\nE. Allergen immunotherapy based on skin testing: Allergen immunotherapy is indicated for specific IgE-mediated allergies to identified allergens. The patient's anaphylaxis is described as \"idiopathic,\" and no specific allergen trigger has been identified. Therefore, immunotherapy is not indicated in this scenario.\n\nConsidering the patient's refractory symptoms and the underlying pathophysiology suggested by alpha-tryptasemia and anaphylaxis, a direct mast cell stabilizer is the most appropriate next therapeutic intervention. Cromolyn sodium is a well-established agent specifically for this purpose. While ketotifen also possesses mast cell stabilizing properties, cromolyn sodium is often considered a cornerstone therapy in mast cell activation syndromes when other treatments fail.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$."}]
