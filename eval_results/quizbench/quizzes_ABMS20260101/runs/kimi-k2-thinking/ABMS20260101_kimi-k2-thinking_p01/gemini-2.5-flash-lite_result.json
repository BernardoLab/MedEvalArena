Surgery is a significant thrombotic stimulus that can exacerbate this risk.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. Proceeding without prophylaxis is inappropriate given the profound coagulation factor deficiencies and the thrombotic risk associated with surgery.\nB. Prophylactic enoxaparin (LMWH) relies heavily on antithrombin III to exert its anticoagulant effect. With ATIII levels at 45%, the efficacy of enoxaparin would likely be significantly reduced, making it a less optimal choice.\nC. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) contains all coagulation factors, both procoagulant and anticoagulant. While it would replete ATIII, protein C, and protein S, it also provides procoagulant factors, which might not be ideal in a hypercoagulable state and could potentially increase bleeding risk or not optimally balance coagulation.\nD. PMM2-CDG is a genetic disorder. Nutritional support will not correct the underlying genetic defect or the resulting deficiencies in coagulation proteins, making this option incorrect.\nE. Administering antithrombin III concentrate directly addresses the severe deficiency in ATIII, which is a critical component of the anticoagulant pathway. This is a targeted approach to restore adequate antithrombotic capacity and is the standard of care for prophylaxis or treatment of thrombosis in patients with severe ATIII deficiency.

Severe colchicine poisoning affects multiple organ systems, including the gastrointestinal tract, bone marrow, liver, kidneys, and central nervous system. Treatment is largely supportive, as there is no specific antidote that is universally accepted and proven to reduce mortality significantly. However, the question asks to identify an intervention that *has demonstrated* mortality reduction, implying evidence exists, even if limited or experimental.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\nA. Colchicine-specific Fab fragments: While antibody fragments are used for some poisonings (e.g., digoxin, venom), there is limited evidence or availability of colchicine-specific Fab fragments that have demonstrated mortality reduction in human poisonings. Colchicine is a small molecule and is widely distributed, which poses challenges for antibody-based therapies.\n\nB. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF): Colchicine toxicity classically causes profound bone marrow suppression, leading to severe neutropenia and increased risk of fatal infections. While the patient in the question presents with leukocytosis, this can be transient, and bone marrow aplasia is a common and life-threatening complication of severe colchicine poisoning. A recent case series (Hants et al., 2021) reported associated survival in patients treated with G-CSF for severe colchicine poisoning, suggesting potential mortality reduction by mitigating or treating the expected neutropenia and subsequent sepsis. This intervention targets a major cause of death in colchicine poisoning.\n\nC. Continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH): Colchicine is highly protein-bound (around 50%) and has a large volume of distribution, making extracorporeal methods like CVVH generally ineffective for clearing the toxin and reducing mortality. Toxins must be present in the blood and unbound to be effectively removed by such methods.\n\nD. N-acetylcysteine (NAC): NAC is a well-established antidote for acetaminophen poisoning. It has no known mechanism of action or proven efficacy in colchicine poisoning.\n\nE. Plasma exchange: Similar to CVVH, plasma exchange is unlikely to be effective in significantly removing colchicine from the body due to its high protein binding and wide distribution into tissues.\n\nBased on the available literature, G-CSF (Option B) is the intervention among the choices that has some recent evidence suggesting potential mortality reduction in severe colchicine poisoning, primarily by addressing the risk of fatal neutropenic infections, a hallmark complication. The Hants et al. study provides data showing an association with survival in a series of cases where G-CSF was administered early.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p01-003", "question": "A 32-year-old woman presents with irregular vaginal bleeding 18 months after an uncomplicated term delivery.

The persistently elevated serum hCG of 150 mIU/mL, although mild, indicates a residual trophoblastic event. The pelvic MRI shows an intrauterine mass, consistent with a retained gestational trophoblastic neoplasm.\n\nThe endometrial biopsy findings are crucial:\n1.  Sheets of intermediate trophoblastic cells: This points away from choriocarcinoma (which primarily consists of cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts) and moles (which involve villous structures).\n2.  Eosinophilic cytoplasm: Characteristic of intermediate trophoblasts.\n3.  Low mitotic index: Suggests a less aggressive proliferation compared to choriocarcinoma.\n4.  Immunohistochemistry:\n    *   Strongly positive for hPL (human placental lactogen): hPL is produced by intermediate trophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts.\n    *   Negative for hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin): This is a key distinguishing feature. While syncytiotrophoblasts produce high levels of hCG, intermediate trophoblasts produce lower levels, and their production of hCG can be variable or absent in certain lesions.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA.  Choriocarcinoma: Characterized by sheets of anaplastic cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts, with a high mitotic index and typically very high hCG levels. The biopsy findings (intermediate trophoblasts, low mitotic index, negative hCG) are inconsistent with choriocarcinoma.\nB.  Placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT): This rare tumor arises from intermediate trophoblasts that invade the placental site/myometrium. Histologically, it is characterized by sheets of intermediate trophoblastic cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and a low mitotic index. PSTTs produce hPL, and hCG levels are often low or undetectable. The biopsy description precisely matches PSTT. The delayed presentation is also typical for PSTT, which can grow slowly.\nC.  Epithelioid trophoblastic tumor (ETT): ETTs are also rare tumors arising from intermediate trophoblasts. They are characterized by epithelioid morphology of intermediate trophoblast cells, often arranged in nests, cords, or sheets, associated with villous structures. Similar to PSTT, they typically produce hPL and have low or absent hCG. While ETT can have sheets of intermediate trophoblasts, the description \" Epithelioid trophoblastic tumor\" specifically highlights the epithelioid morphology, which is not explicitly mentioned in the provided description. However, it is closely related to PSTT, and the distinction can be challenging. Given the prominent description of \"sheets of intermediate trophoblastic cells\" without further mention of epithelioid appearance or villi, PSTT is often the primary consideration.\nD.  Persistent hydatidiform mole: This would involve retained molar villi with trophoblastic proliferation. The biopsy does not describe villous structures. hCG levels are typically higher in persistent moles than the mild elevation seen here, although some variability exists.\nE.  Invasive mole: An invasive mole is the myometrial invasion by a hydatidiform mole. Like persistent mole, it involves molar villi and typically has high hCG levels.\n\nComparing PSTT and ETT: Both are tumors of intermediate trophoblasts with similar immunohistochemical profiles (high hPL, low/neg hCG). However, the description \"sheets of intermediate trophoblastic cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, low mitotic index\" is considered classic for PSTT. ETTs, while also arising from intermediate trophoblasts and sometimes exhibiting sheet-like growth, are morphologically defined by their epithelioid cells and often their association with villous structures. Without specific mention of epithelioid morphology or villi, PSTT is the most direct fit for the given histological description.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p01-004", "question": "A 28-year-old male with a dibucaine number of 20 (normal >70) and pseudocholinesterase activity of 0.2 U/mL (normal 0.5-1.2) requires emergency intubation for airway obstruction.

Anti-phospholipid antibodies are associated with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), which can coexist with SLE.

Chemoradiation (50.4 Gy) with boost to obturator node, then TME with selective lateral dissection if node persists: Boosting a single node is not a standard practice, and a \"wait-and-see\" approach for lateral dissection is less proactive than a comprehensive neoadjuvant strategy.\nD.

Despite six cycles of systemic chemotherapy and three intravitreal melphalan injections (30 µg each) in the right eye, there are persistent class 3 vitreous seeds. While tumor regression is noted, the presence of diffuse non-confluent vitreous opacities (representing residual seeds or treatment effects) indicates that the previous treatment was not fully curative for the vitreous seeding. The question asks for the *next definitive management step*.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\nA. Increasing the intravitreal melphalan dose to 50 µg weekly for three doses: This is an escalation of the current treatment modality. While higher doses are sometimes used, and increasing frequency/dose is a consideration for refractory disease, it might not be the most definitive step if seeds have proven resistant to multiple injections of standard dose.\nB. Plaque brachytherapy with 125I to deliver 40 Gy to vitreous base: Plaque brachytherapy is a highly effective focal radiotherapy treatment for intraocular retinoblastoma, particularly for recurrent or refractory tumors and significant vitreous seeding. It delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor site, offering good local control rates with the aim of globe salvage. Persistent vitreous seeds after initial chemotherapy and focal treatments (including intravitreal injections) are a common indication for plaque brachytherapy.\nC. Enucleation with histopathologic risk factor assessment: Enucleation is the surgical removal of the eye. It is considered when globe salvage is not possible or when there is a high risk of metastasis or secondary malignancy. Given that tumor regression is observed and the aim is typically globe preservation in bilateral disease, enucleation is usually reserved for eyes where salvage therapies have failed or are contraindicated, or if high-risk factors are present. It is a definitive treatment but represents a failure of globe salvage.\nD. Intravitreal topotecan 20 µg alternating with melphalan every 2 weeks: This represents another strategy to escalate intravitreal chemotherapy by introducing a different drug and an alternating schedule. This is a plausible next step to try to clear remaining seeds, but similar to option A, it's an extension of intravitreal chemotherapy rather than a different therapeutic modality.\nE. External beam radiation therapy 45 Gy to entire globe: External beam radiation therapy (EBTR) was historically used but is now generally avoided due to significant risks of complications, including radiation-induced retinopathy, neovascular glaucoma, optic neuropathy, and secondary malignancies. Focal treatments like plaque brachytherapy are preferred when possible for localized disease.\n\nConsidering the persistence of significant vitreous seeding (class 3) despite multiple cycles of systemic chemotherapy and three therapeutic intravitreal melphalan injections, a more definitive local treatment is warranted. Plaque brachytherapy is a well-established and effective method for achieving local control of retinoblastoma, especially for recalcitrant vitreous seeds. It targets the disease directly with high-dose radiation, offering a good chance of globe salvage. While further intravitreal chemotherapy (options A and D) is possible, plaque brachytherapy (option B) is often considered a more definitive next step when initial attempts at clearing significant vitreous seeds have not been fully successful and globe salvage is still desired. Enucleation (option C) is a consequence of failed salvage, and EBTR (option E) carries higher toxicity than plaque brachytherapy.\n\nTherefore, plaque brachytherapy is the most appropriate *next definitive management step* for persistent class 3 vitreous seeds after standard treatments have been administered.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p01-008", "question": "A 78-year-old woman falls and sustains a four-part proximal humerus fracture with head-split pattern and 2 cm medial calcar comminution.

Key features include:\n1.  Four-part fracture: This is a complex pattern involving displacement of the humeral head, shaft, greater tuberosity, and lesser tuberosity.\n2.  Head-split pattern: This suggests a fracture line through the articular surface of the humeral head, potentially compromising its viability or making anatomical reconstruction very difficult.\n3.  2 cm medial calcar comminution: The medial calcar is critical for the structural integrity and biomechanical support of the proximal humerus. Significant comminution here makes any attempt at internal fixation (ORIF) or even stable repair of tuberosities for hemiarthroplasty very challenging with a high risk of failure (e.g., screw cut-out, nonunion).\n4.  Greater tuberosity fractured but not displaced: While less severe than a displaced fracture, this still needs to be addressed, especially in relation to rotator cuff function.\n5.  Age (78 years): Elderly patients often have poorer bone quality (osteoporosis), which further increases the risk of hardware failure with internal fixation. They also tend to have less functional reserve and may not tolerate extensive revision surgeries well.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\n*   A. ORIF with locking plate and fibular allograft: While a locking plate offers stability, a four-part fracture with 2 cm calcar comminution in an elderly osteoporotic patient has a very high risk of failure (nonunion, malunion, screw pull-out, avascular necrosis of the head) even with grafting. This is generally considered a suboptimal choice for this specific complex pattern in this demographic.\n*   B. Hemiarthroplasty with cemented stem and tuberosity repair: Hemiarthroplasty addresses the difficult articular surface but relies heavily on the successful healing of the tuberosities to restore function, as the rotator cuff muscles attach to them. With significant medial calcar comminution, achieving stable fixation of the tuberosities sufficiently to ensure healing and good function is a major concern and a common source of poor outcomes.\n*   C. Reverse shoulder arthroplasty with 36 mm glenosphere and augmented baseplate: Reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) is often indicated for complex, unstable proximal humerus fractures in the elderly, especially when rotator cuff integrity is uncertain or anatomical reconstruction is unlikely to yield good results. The deltoid muscle becomes the primary mover, bypassing the need for intact rotator cuff insertion for elevation. The \"augmented baseplate\" specifically implies increased fixation strength, which is crucial for osteoporotic bone and comminuted fragments, making it a superior choice for challenging cases. The 36 mm glenosphere is a common size. This option addresses the instability and potential for poor rotator cuff function in a predictable manner for functional recovery.\n*   D. Reverse shoulder arthroplasty with standard baseplate and tuberosity preservation: While RTSA is appropriate, a \"standard baseplate\" might not provide adequate fixation in a patient with significant comminution and likely osteoporotic bone. The term \"tuberosity preservation\" in the context of RTSA can be ambiguous; often tuberosities are still reattached to the prosthesis or stem to optimize function, but their direct anatomical reconstruction is less critical than in hemiarthroplasty. The inclusion of an *augmented* baseplate in option C makes it a stronger choice for the described pathology.\n*   E. Nonoperative management: A four-part fracture with significant comminution is too unstable and severe for nonoperative management in an elderly patient if a functional outcome is desired. This would likely lead to significant deformity, pain, and loss of function.\n\nConsidering the extreme comminution of the calcar and the head-split pattern in an elderly patient, the stability of fixation is paramount. An augmented baseplate for RTSA (Option C) is designed for precisely these challenging scenarios where enhanced fixation is required, offering the most reliable pathway to functional recovery compared to the high failure risks associated with ORIF or the tuberosity healing uncertainties of hemiarthroplasty.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p01-009", "question": "A 45-year-old with severe ARDS on VV-ECMO develops suspected heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (4T score 6).

This is a significant interfering factor for many coagulation assays.\n4.  Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and Activated clotting time (ACT) are global assays that measure the time it takes for blood to clot. Argatroban prolongs both. However, both aPTT and ACT are known to be significantly affected by hemolysis, which can lead to inaccurate and unreliable results, making titration difficult. High free hemoglobin levels can directly interfere with the clotting process or the reagents used in these assays.\n5.

While hemolysis *can* interfere with chromogenic assays due to the peroxidase activity of hemoglobin and its color, this interference is often less profound or more manageable with specific laboratory techniques compared to the disruption caused to global clotting assays like aPTT and ACT. When aPTT is deemed unreliable due to various factors (including hemolysis, lupus anticoagulants, etc.), the anti-IIa chromogenic assay is considered the most reliable specific method for monitoring argatroban therapy.

The CSF1R gene is critical for the development and function of microglia, which are the resident immune cells of the central nervous system derived from hematopoietic stem cells. In CSF1R-related leukoencephalopathies, the defect is presumed to lie within these cells.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA.

Replenishing the CNS with functional microglia derived from healthy stem cells is the rationale behind its efficacy in this genetic condition.\nD. Ruxolitinib is a JAK inhibitor.
