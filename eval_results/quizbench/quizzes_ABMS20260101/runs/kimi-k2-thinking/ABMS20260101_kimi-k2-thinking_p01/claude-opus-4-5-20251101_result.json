PMM2-CDG and coagulation: This condition affects glycosylation of proteins, including coagulation factors. Patients typically have deficiencies in both procoagulant AND anticoagulant factors (antithrombin III, protein C, protein S). This creates a complex hemostatic balance.\n\n2. The coagulation profile: Shows significant deficiencies in natural anticoagulants:\n   - Antithrombin III: 45% (severely low)\n   - Protein C: 38% (severely low)\n   - Protein S: 32% (severely low)\n\n3. Thrombotic vs bleeding risk: In PMM2-CDG, both procoagulant and anticoagulant factors are typically reduced. The balance is often maintained, but surgery can tip this balance. The question specifically asks about minimizing THROMBOTIC risk.\n\nAnalyzing options:\n\nA. Proceed without prophylaxis - Not ideal given the significant anticoagulant deficiencies and surgical stress.\n\nB. Prophylactic enoxaparin - Anticoagulation with heparin-based products requires adequate antithrombin III to work effectively. With AT-III at 45%, enoxaparin would have reduced efficacy.\n\nC. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) - Would provide both procoagulant and anticoagulant factors, potentially maintaining the existing balance. This is commonly used in CDG patients undergoing surgery.\n\nD. Delay indefinitely - These deficiencies won't normalize with nutritional support as they're due to the underlying genetic defect in glycosylation.\n\nE. Antithrombin III concentrate - While this addresses the AT-III deficiency specifically, giving only anticoagulant replacement without addressing the procoagulant deficiencies could paradoxically increase bleeding risk.\n\nThe most balanced approach for PMM2-CDG patients undergoing surgery is FFP transfusion, which replaces both procoagulant and anticoagulant factors proportionally, maintaining hemostatic balance while providing some correction of the severe anticoagulant deficiencies. This is the standard recommendation in CDG management guidelines for surgical procedures.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p01-002", "question": "A 26-year-old woman ingests 60 mg of colchicine in a suicide attempt, presenting 8 hours later with profuse vomiting and diarrhea.

For a typical adult woman, this represents a potentially lethal dose.\n\nThe presentation at 8 hours with profuse vomiting and diarrhea is consistent with the GI phase of colchicine toxicity.

Case reports and small series from France have demonstrated that early administration (within 12-24 hours) of colchicine-specific Fab fragments can reduce mortality in severe poisoning by binding free colchicine and preventing further cellular uptake.\n\nB. G-CSF - While this may help with the bone marrow suppression that occurs later, it doesn't address the acute toxicity mechanism and hasn't been shown to reduce mortality when given early.\n\nC. CVVH - Colchicine has a large volume of distribution (5-8 L/kg) and is highly protein-bound, making dialysis/hemofiltration ineffective for removal.\n\nD. N-acetylcysteine - This is the antidote for acetaminophen poisoning, not colchicine. There's no established role for NAC in colchicine toxicity.\n\nE. Plasma exchange - Given colchicine's large volume of distribution and intracellular accumulation, plasma exchange would not effectively remove the drug.\n\nColchicine-specific Fab fragments (goat-derived anti-colchicine antibodies) have been used successfully in France and have shown mortality benefit in case series when administered early in severe colchicine poisoning.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p01-003", "question": "A 32-year-old woman presents with irregular vaginal bleeding 18 months after an uncomplicated term delivery.

ORIF with locking plate (Option A): The head-split pattern with articular involvement, combined with 2 cm medial calcar comminution in an elderly patient, makes fixation very challenging. Even with fibular allograft augmentation, the risk of avascular necrosis and fixation failure is high. The medial calcar comminution >8mm is a poor prognostic factor for ORIF.\n\n2. Hemiarthroplasty (Option B): While historically used for complex proximal humerus fractures, outcomes in elderly patients have been disappointing, particularly regarding tuberosity healing and functional recovery. The functional results are often poor.\n\n3. Reverse shoulder arthroplasty (Options C and D): RSA has become the preferred treatment for complex proximal humerus fractures in elderly patients because it doesn't rely on tuberosity healing for function. The deltoid-powered design allows for better functional outcomes.\n\n4. Option C vs D: Given the 2 cm medial calcar comminution, there's significant bone loss. A 36 mm glenosphere provides better deltoid tensioning and mechanical advantage. An augmented baseplate may be beneficial if there's glenoid bone stock concerns, though this is more relevant for revision or rotator cuff arthropathy cases. The larger glenosphere helps with stability and range of motion.\n\n5. Nonoperative (Option E): For a displaced four-part fracture with head-split in a functional patient, nonoperative management typically leads to poor outcomes.\n\nBest answer: Given the elderly patient, four-part fracture with head-split pattern, and significant medial calcar comminution, RSA is the optimal choice. The 36 mm glenosphere provides better mechanical advantage, and augmented baseplate can help with fixation in potentially osteoporotic glenoid bone.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p01-009", "question": "A 45-year-old with severe ARDS on VV-ECMO develops suspected heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (4T score 6).

Significant hemolysis (plasma free hemoglobin 800 mg/dL)\n\nThe question asks about the most reliable monitoring assay for argatroban in the setting of significant hemolysis.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nA. aPTT - This is the standard monitoring test for argatroban. However, aPTT can be affected by hemolysis because free hemoglobin interferes with optical detection methods used in many coagulators.\n\nB. Anti-Xa chromogenic assay - This measures anti-Xa activity, which is used for heparin and low molecular weight heparins. Argatroban is a direct thrombin (factor IIa) inhibitor, not a factor Xa inhibitor, so this would not be appropriate.\n\nC. Anti-IIa (thrombin) chromogenic assay - This directly measures thrombin inhibition, which is the mechanism of argatroban. Chromogenic assays measure color change at specific wavelengths and can be designed to minimize interference from hemolysis. This provides a direct measurement of argatroban's anticoagulant effect.\n\nD. ACT - Activated clotting time is commonly used during ECMO but is affected by many variables including hemolysis, platelet count, and other factors. It's less specific and reliable in this setting.\n\nE. dRVVT - This is primarily used for lupus anticoagulant testing, not for monitoring direct thrombin inhibitors.\n\nIn the setting of significant hemolysis (plasma free Hgb 800 mg/dL is very high), clot-based assays like aPTT and ACT can be unreliable due to interference from free hemoglobin. Chromogenic assays are generally more resistant to interference from hemolysis.\n\nSince argatroban is a direct thrombin inhibitor, the anti-IIa chromogenic assay would directly measure its effect and is more reliable in the presence of hemolysis compared to clot-based assays.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p01-010", "question": "A 42-year-old man with a heterozygous CSF1R p.Arg782His mutation and early-stage adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids (ALSP) has mild cognitive impairment and gait instability.

The disease is characterized by progressive cognitive decline, motor dysfunction, and white matter abnormalities.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\nA. Intravenous immunoglobulin monthly - IVIG is used for autoimmune conditions. ALSP is not an autoimmune disease but a genetic microgliopathy. No evidence supports this approach.\n\nB. Oral cyclophosphamide - This immunosuppressant has no established role in treating ALSP, which is a genetic/degenerative condition, not inflammatory/autoimmune.\n\nC. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) - This is the key intervention. Since ALSP is caused by dysfunctional microglia (which are derived from hematopoietic precursors), HSCT can replace the defective microglia with donor-derived healthy cells. Multiple case reports and small series have shown that HSCT performed early in the disease course (before severe disability) can stabilize or even improve symptoms. This is currently the only disease-modifying treatment with demonstrated efficacy.\n\nD. Ruxolitinib - This JAK inhibitor has been explored in some microglial disorders, but there is no established evidence for its efficacy in ALSP as a disease-modifying treatment.\n\nE. Supportive care with donepezil - Donepezil is a cholinesterase inhibitor used symptomatically for dementia. It does not modify disease progression.\n\nThe critical point is that HSCT has shown disease-modifying effects in ALSP when performed early, before severe neurological deterioration. The mechanism involves replacement of dysfunctional CSF1R-mutant microglia with healthy donor-derived cells that can migrate to the brain.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}]
