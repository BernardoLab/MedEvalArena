However, hemolysis can falsely prolong or shorten aPTT due to optical interference and release of thromboplastic substances from RBCs. Unreliable in this case.\n\nB. Anti-Xa chromogenic assay - This measures anti-factor Xa activity. Argatroban is a direct thrombin inhibitor (not anti-Xa), so this wouldn't be appropriate for argatroban monitoring.\n\nC. Anti-IIa (thrombin) chromogenic assay - This directly measures thrombin inhibition, which is argatroban's mechanism of action. Chromogenic assays use synthetic substrates and are less susceptible to optical interference from hemolysis compared to clotting-based assays. This is specifically designed to measure direct thrombin inhibitor activity.\n\nD. ACT - While used for ECMO monitoring, ACT is also affected by hemolysis and is less specific for argatroban titration.\n\nE. dRVVT - This is used for lupus anticoagulant detection, not for argatroban monitoring.\n\nWhy C is best:\nChromogenic assays measure enzymatic activity directly using synthetic substrates rather than relying on optical clotting detection. They are more resistant to interference from hemolysis compared to clotting-based assays (aPTT, ACT). The anti-IIa chromogenic assay directly measures argatroban's effect on thrombin, making it the most reliable choice in this hemolytic patient.\n\nThe answer is C"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p01-010", "question": "A 42-year-old man with a heterozygous CSF1R p.Arg782His mutation and early-stage adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids (ALSP) has mild cognitive impairment and gait instability.

Disease pathophysiology: CSF1R mutations lead to dysfunction of microglia and macrophages, causing progressive white matter disease with axonal spheroids.\n\n2. Treatment evidence:\n   - IVIG: Limited evidence, not disease-modifying\n   - Cyclophosphamide: Some case reports but not established as disease-modifying\n   - Allogeneic HSCT: This has shown the most promising results in ALSP. Multiple case series and small studies have demonstrated that early HSCT (particularly from HLA-matched donors) can halt or slow disease progression when performed before severe motor disability develops. The rationale is to replace dysfunctional microglia with donor-derived cells.\n   - Ruxolitinib: A JAK inhibitor that has shown promise in recent studies for ALSP by modulating microglial activation, but the evidence base is still emerging and more recent than established HSCT data.\n   - Donepezil: Symptomatic only, not disease-modifying\n\n3. Clinical context: The patient has early-stage disease with mild cognitive impairment and gait instability (before severe motor disability), which is the optimal window for intervention.\n\n4. Evidence strength: Allogeneic HSCT has the longest track record of demonstrating disease modification in ALSP when performed early, with documented cases of disease stabilization or improvement.\n\nThe answer is C"}]
