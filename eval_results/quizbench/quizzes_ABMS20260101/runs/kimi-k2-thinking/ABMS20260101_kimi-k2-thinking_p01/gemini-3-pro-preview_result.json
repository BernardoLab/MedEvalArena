A hallmark of this condition is the hypoglycosylation of various serum proteins, including coagulation factors and anticoagulants.\n\nClinically, these patients often demonstrate a complex coagulopathy. While they have deficiencies in pro-coagulant factors, the deficiencies in naturally occurring anticoagulants—specifically Antithrombin III (ATIII), Protein C, and Protein S—are often more profound, leading to a hypercoagulable state and a significant risk of thrombotic events (like DVT or stroke), especially during periods of stress such as surgery or infection.\n\n1.  Pathophysiology: Antithrombin III is the primary inhibitor of the coagulation cascade. Its activity is potentiated by heparin. When ATIII levels are significantly low (as is the 45% seen in this patient), the body loses its primary \"brake\" on clotting.\n2.  Inefficacy of Heparin: Enoxaparin (Option B) is a Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH). Heparins work by binding to and activating Antithrombin III. If ATIII is depleted, heparin products are ineffective (heparin resistance). Therefore, prophylactic heparin alone is not the best choice.\n3.  Appropriate Management: The standard of care for perioperative management in PMM2-CDG patients with low ATIII is to replace the deficient factor. Antithrombin III concentrate (Option E) is preferred over Fresh Frozen Plasma (Option C) because it allows for precise correction of the deficiency without the risks of volume overload, transfusion-related lung injury (TRALI), or allergic reactions associated with large volumes of plasma.\n4.  Dosing: A dose of 50 IU/kg is appropriate to raise the ATIII level by approximately 50-60%, aiming to bring the patient's level (45%) up to a normal range (near 100%) to ensure adequate surgical hemostasis and thrombosis prevention.\n\nCurrent guidelines for PMM2-CDG recommend monitoring ATIII levels prior to surgery and correcting them if levels are low (<60-70%) to minimize thrombotic risk.\n\nThe answer is (E)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p01-002", "question": "A 26-year-old woman ingests 60 mg of colchicine in a suicide attempt, presenting 8 hours later with profuse vomiting and diarrhea.

(NEJM 1995) regarding the use of Colchicine-specific Fab fragments.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the options:\n\n*   A. Colchicine-specific Fab fragments 4 g IV bolus: Colchicine poisoning is associated with high mortality, particularly with ingestions >0.5 mg/kg or massive overdoses like 60 mg. The mechanism of death involves cardiogenic shock (within 24-48 hours) and multiorgan failure/sepsis (delayed). Colchicine-specific Fab fragments are the only specific antidote. Although not commercially available in many regions (making them an experimental or compassionate-use therapy), they have demonstrated mortality reduction and reversal of cardiogenic shock in severe human poisoning in the literature. The stated dose of 4 g is stoichiometrically appropriate for a 60 mg ingestion (Colchicine MW ~400, Fab MW ~50,000; ratio ~1:125; 60mg x 125 = 7.5g for full neutralization, so 4 g is a substantial therapeutic dose). The famous Baud case used a lower dose (480 mg) but established the efficacy of the treatment, and theoretical models support equimolar dosing.\n*   B. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) 5 μg/kg/day subcutaneously: G-CSF is used to treat the bone marrow suppression (leukopenia/neutropenia) that occurs several days after ingestion. It is not indicated within the first 12 hours (when the patient typically has leukocytosis due to demargination/stress). While it aids in recovery from the later sepsis phase, it does not prevent the earlier cardiovascular collapse which is the immediate threat in massive overdose, nor is its initiation indicated this early.\n*   C, D, E: Colchicine has a large volume of distribution (up to 21 L/kg) and is widely distributed in tissues. Therefore, extracorporeal removal methods like CVVH (C) and Plasma Exchange (E) are ineffective. N-acetylcysteine (D) has no proven role in reducing mortality in colchicine poisoning in humans.\n\nTherefore, the administration of Colchicine-specific Fab fragments is the intervention that has demonstrated dramatic improvement and mortality reduction in this specific scenario described in medical literature.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p01-003", "question": "A 32-year-old woman presents with irregular vaginal bleeding 18 months after an uncomplicated term delivery.

Diagnosis: The patient has a low dibucaine number (20) and low pseudocholinesterase activity, leading to prolonged apnea (90 minutes) after the administration of succinylcholine. A dibucaine number of 20 indicates the patient is homozygous for the atypical plasma cholinesterase gene.\n2.  Pathophysiology: Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker that is rapidly hydrolyzed by pseudocholinesterase in the plasma. In patients with a deficiency or atypical form of this enzyme, the drug remains at the neuromuscular junction for a much longer duration, causing prolonged paralysis.\n3.  Shared Metabolic Pathway: To answer the question, we must identify which other drugs are metabolized by pseudocholinesterase.\n    *   Ester local anesthetics (Option B): Drugs such as procaine, chloroprocaine, tetracaine, and cocaine are esters that are hydrolyzed by pseudocholinesterase. In a patient with this enzyme deficiency, the metabolism of ester local anesthetics is impaired, potentially leading to prolonged action and increased risk of systemic toxicity.\n    *   Mivacurium: Although not listed as an option, this non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker is also metabolized by pseudocholinesterase and would have a prolonged duration of action.\n4.  Other Options:\n    *   Rocuronium (Option A) and Vecuronium (Option C): These are aminosteroid non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers metabolized primarily by the liver and excreted in bile/urine. They are safe to use in these patients.\n    *   Cisatracurium (Option D): This is metabolized primarily via Hofmann elimination (organ-independent chemical degradation) and nonspecific esterases. It is not dependent on pseudocholinesterase.\n    *   Remifentanil (Option E): While it is an ester and metabolized by hydrolysis, it is broken down by widespread nonspecific blood and tissue esterases, *not* predominantly by pseudocholinesterase. Its metabolism is generally unaffected in patients with this deficiency.\n\nTherefore, ester local anesthetics share the metabolic pathway with succinylcholine and should be used with caution or avoided (especially in large doses) in this patient.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p01-005", "question": "A 22-year-old female with systemic lupus erythematosus presents with nihilistic delusions that her organs have 'turned to dust' and that she is already dead.

Increasing the dose to 50 µg significantly increases the risk of retinal toxicity and complications (e.g., chorioretinal atrophy, hypotony) and is not the standard protocol.\n*   B) Plaque brachytherapy with 125I to deliver 40 Gy to vitreous base: Plaque brachytherapy is indicated for focal retinal tumors. It does not provide adequate coverage for diffuse vitreous seeds (\"clouds\") and is not the treatment for vitreous disease.\n*   C) Enucleation with histopathologic risk factor assessment: In bilateral retinoblastoma, the goal is to salvage the eye and vision if possible, provided it is safe. Since the main tumor has regressed and the issue is vitreous seeds, and there are still globe-salvaging pharmacological options available, enucleation is not the immediate choices unless the eye is blind or painful, or the tumor burden is unmanageable.\n*   D) Intravitreal topotecan 20 µg alternating with melphalan every 2 weeks: Vitreous clouds (Class 3 seeds) are difficult to treat and often require more intensive therapy than dust (Class 1) or spheres (Class 2). When seeds persist or are refractory to melphalan alone, or to reduce melphalan toxicity while maintaining efficacy, the addition of intravitreal topotecan (typically 20 µg) is the standard next step. Studies (e.g., by Francis et al. and the Memorial Sloan Kettering group) have demonstrated the efficacy of intravitreal topotecan for seeds refractory to melphalan.\n*   E) External beam radiation therapy 45 Gy to entire globe: While EBRT is effective for seeds, it is generally avoided in children under 4 years old (especially with germline RB) due to the high risk of secondary malignancies (sarcomas) in the radiation field and facial hypoplasia. It is reserved for eyes where intravitreal chemotherapy has completely failed and enucleation is the only other option.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate escalation of therapy for persistent/refractory seeds that preserves the globe and minimizes radiation risk is the addition of intravitreal topotecan.\n\nThe answer is (D)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p01-008", "question": "A 78-year-old woman falls and sustains a four-part proximal humerus fracture with head-split pattern and 2 cm medial calcar comminution.

Analysis of the Injury and Patient:\n    *   Patient Age: At 78 years old, the bone quality is likely osteopenic or osteoporotic.\n    *   Fracture Pattern: The fracture is a four-part fracture with a head-split pattern and medial calcar comminution.\n    *   Head-Split: This is a crucial detail. A head-split pattern implies that the articular surface of the humeral head is fractured, isolating fragments from their blood supply and disrupting the joint surface. This makes the fracture effectively non-reconstructible via Open Reduction and Internal Fixation (ORIF), as the risk of avascular necrosis (AVN), screw cutout, and failure is extremely high.\n    *   Medial Calcar Comminution: This represents a loss of medial support, which is a strong predictor of varus collapse and fixation failure in ORIF.\n    *   Greater Tuberosity (GT): Fractured but not displaced. The healing and positioning of the tuberosities are critical for functional outcomes (particularly rotation) in arthroplasty.\n\n2.  Evaluation of Options:\n    *   A) ORIF with locking plate and fibular allograft: While fibular allografts are used to address medial calcar comminution, the head-split pattern is a strong contraindication for ORIF in an elderly patient. The articular surface is destroyed and unlikely to survive or function well.\n    *   B) Hemiarthroplasty (HA): Historically used for 4-part fractures. However, HA outcomes rely heavily on tuberosity healing. In elderly patients, tuberosity nonunion/resorption is common, leading to unpredictable results and \"anterosuperior escape.\" Current literature favors Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty (RSA) over HA for this demographic due to more predictable pain relief and function.\n    *   C) Reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) with augmented baseplate: RSA is the correct procedure class. However, augmented baseplates (e.g., wedge augments) are indicated for varying degrees of glenoid bone loss/deformity (such as in osteoarthritis with retroversion). The scenario describes an acute fracture with no mention of pre-existing glenoid wear or deformity. Therefore, using an augmented baseplate is not the standard \"optimal\" selection without that specific indication.\n    *   D) Reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) with standard baseplate and tuberosity preservation: RSA is the preferred treatment for a non-reconstructible (head-split) 4-part fracture in a 78-year-old. It provides functional elevation through the deltoid even if questions remain about the cuff, though tuberosity repair (\"preservation\") is standard to improve external rotation and stability. A standard baseplate is appropriate for a patient with normal glenoid morphology (the typical assumption in acute fracture without mentioned OA).\n    *   E) Nonoperative management: While valid for many proximal humerus fractures, head-splitting patterns in active elderly patients result in significant incongruity and pain. Arthroplasty offers a better functional baseline than a neglected split head.\n\n3.  Conclusion: The combination of age (78) and a head-splitting fracture indicates joint replacement. RSA is superior to Hemiarthroplasty in this age group. With no glenoid deformity described, a standard baseplate is used. Preserving and repairing the tuberosities is critical for optimal rotation and function.\n\nThe answer is (D)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p01-009", "question": "A 45-year-old with severe ARDS on VV-ECMO develops suspected heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (4T score 6).

While the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is the standard method for monitoring argatroban, it can be unreliable in critically ill patients, particularly those with lupus anticoagulants, elevated factor VIII (common in inflammation/ECMO), or significant hemolysis.\n\n1.  Hemolysis and Optical Interference: The patient has a plasma free hemoglobin of 800 mg/dL, which indicates severe hemolysis. Most automated coagulation analyzers use photo-optical detection methods to determine the clotting time (aPTT). Free hemoglobin absorbs light and can interfere with these optical endpoint detections, rendering the aPTT unreliable (can be falsely prolonged or shortened, or result in technical error).\n2.  Anti-Xa Assay (Option B): This assay is used to monitor Factor Xa inhibitors (like low molecular weight heparin, unfractionated heparin, or oral Xa inhibitors). Argatroban is a direct thrombin (Factor IIa) inhibitor and has no effect on Factor Xa. Thus, this assay cannot monitor argatroban.\n3.  Activated Clotting Time (ACT) (Option D): While ACT is used for high-dose heparin monitoring (e.g., during cardiopulmonary bypass or sometimes ECMO) and is often mechanically detected (less affected by color), it correlates poorly with argatroban concentrations at therapeutic doses. It is generally not recommended for titrating DTI therapy due to lack of sensitivity and precision compared to aPTT or specific DTI assays.\n4.  dRVVT (Option E): This is a diagnostic test for lupus anticoagulant and is not used for drug monitoring.\n5.  Anti-IIa (Thrombin) Chromogenic Assay (Option C): This assay (often referred to as a quantitative DTI assay or diluted thrombin time in some contexts) specifically measures the inhibition of thrombin, directly correlating with argatroban plasma levels. Unlike the standard aPTT, which is a global clotting test affected by many variables (factor levels, inhibitors), the chromogenic anti-IIa assay is specific to the drug's mechanism. Importantly, regarding the hemolysis: while hemoglobin absorbs at 405 nm (the wavelength used in chromogenic assays), these specific drug assays often utilize sample dilution (e.g., 1:10 or 1:20) which reduces the hemoglobin concentration in the reaction mixture to non-interfering levels, or they use kinetic methods (measuring rate of color change rather than absolute optical density) with sample blanking to mitigate interference. Therefore, in confirmed HIT with confounding factors (like baseline aPTT elevation or hemolysis), the chromogenic anti-IIa assay is the most reliable method for titration.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p01-010", "question": "A 42-year-old man with a heterozygous CSF1R p.Arg782His mutation and early-stage adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids (ALSP) has mild cognitive impairment and gait instability.

Diagnosis: The patient has a confirmed *CSF1R* mutation and clinical features (cognitive impairment, gait instability) consistent with Adult-onset Leukoencephalopathy with Axonal Spheroids and Pigmented glia (ALSP), previously often referred to as Hereditary Diffuse Leukoencephalopathy with Spheroids (HDLS).\n\n2.  Pathophysiology: ALSP is a primary microgliopathy. The *CSF1R* gene encodes a receptor critical for the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of microglia. The mutation leads to microglial dysfunction and subsequent demyelination and axonal loss.\n\n3.  Treatment Options:\n    *   Supportive care (Option E): Drugs like donepezil may offer modest symptomatic benefit for memory, but they do not alter the underlying pathology or stop disease progression.\n    *   Immunosuppression (Options A and B): ALSP is sometimes misdiagnosed as autoimmune conditions (like MS or vasculitis) and treated with steroids, IVIG, or cyclophosphamide. However, studies show these treatments provide no sustained clinical benefit and do not halt the neurodegeneration associated with ALSP.\n    *   Ruxolitinib (Option D): While kinase inhibitors are being investigated for various conditions, they are not the established standard for modifying the course of ALSP.\n    *   Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) (Option C): Microglia originate from the myeloid lineage. Allogeneic HSCT replaces the patient's defective hematopoietic stem cells with healthy donor cells. These donor-derived cells can migrate to the brain and differentiate into functional microglia (or replace the microglial pool), correcting the underlying cellular defect.\n\n4.  Clinical Evidence: Retrospective studies and case series (e.g., *Eichler et al., Brain 2016*) have demonstrated that allogeneic HSCT is currently the only intervention capable of arresting the progression of ALSP. The outcomes are significantly better when the procedure is performed early in the disease course, before the onset of severe motor or cognitive disability, as it stabilizes the condition rather than reversing established damage.\n\n5.  Conclusion: Therefore, allogeneic HSCT represents the intervention with the highest efficacy for disease modification in early-stage ALSP.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}]
