It's characterized by:\n- Sleep disorders (including REM sleep behavior disorder, sleep apnea, stridor)\n- Bulbar dysfunction\n- Gait abnormalities\n- Dysautonomia\n- Progressive course\n\nThe pathophysiology involves both autoimmune mechanisms (anti-IgLON5 antibodies) AND tau deposition (tauopathy), making it distinct from typical autoimmune encephalitis.\n\nRegarding treatment response:\n- Unlike many other autoimmune encephalitides, anti-IgLON5 disease shows LIMITED response to immunotherapy\n- The tauopathy component is not reversible with immunotherapy\n- However, some patients show modest improvement with aggressive immunotherapy\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. High-dose methylprednisolone alone - typically insufficient\nB. Plasma exchange alone - typically insufficient\nC. Rituximab alone - typically insufficient\nD. Combined immunotherapy with steroids, IVIG, and rituximab - This represents the most aggressive approach and has shown modest symptomatic benefit in case series. Given the dual pathophysiology (autoimmune + neurodegeneration), combined/aggressive immunotherapy targeting multiple immune pathways has demonstrated the best (though still modest) outcomes.\nE. Trazodone - While sometimes used for sleep symptoms, it doesn't address the underlying disease process\n\nThe literature on anti-IgLON5 disease suggests that early and aggressive combined immunotherapy may provide modest benefit, though the neurodegenerative component limits overall response. Combined approaches using multiple immunotherapeutic agents have shown the most promise in case reports and small series.\n\nThe answer is (D)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p04-009", "question": "A 76-year-old man with wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRwt) has LV wall thickness 16mm and LVEF 45%.

This means that the base and mid-ventricular segments show significantly reduced longitudinal strain, while the apex is relatively preserved. This creates a characteristic \"cherry on top\" or \"bulls-eye\" pattern on polar maps.\n\nThe relative apical sparing ratio is calculated by dividing the average apical longitudinal strain by the average of basal and mid-ventricular longitudinal strain. A ratio >1.0 (and particularly >1.5 or sometimes cited as >2.0) is highly suggestive of cardiac amyloidosis and helps differentiate it from hypertensive heart disease, where strain reduction tends to be more uniform or may even show basal sparing.\n\nLet me analyze the options:\n- A.
