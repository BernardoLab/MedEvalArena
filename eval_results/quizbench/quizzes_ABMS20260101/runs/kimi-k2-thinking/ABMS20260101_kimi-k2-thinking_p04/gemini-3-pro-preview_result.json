Management requires balancing these opposing conditions.\n\n1.  Assess Current Medication: Amlodipine is a long-acting calcium channel blocker. It lowers blood pressure continuously, which exacerbates daytime orthostatic hypotension and increases fall risk. It should be discontinued in patients with symptomatic nOH.\n\n2.  Pathophysiology of Nocturnal Falls: The patient has severe supine hypertension (185/98 mmHg). Supine hypertension drives \"pressure natriuresis\" (increased excretion of sodium and water by the kidneys due to high renal perfusion pressure). This leads to nocturnal polyuria (nocturia), which forces the patient to get up frequently at night. Upon standing to void, the patient experiences nOH (worsened by the volume depletion from natriuresis), leading to falls.\n\n3.  Management Strategy: The goals are to remove agents worsening the nOH (amlodipine) and to treat the supine hypertension to reduce pressure natriuresis (thereby preserving intravascular volume for the daytime and reducing nocturia/fall risk).\n    *   Pressors (Midodrine, Droxidopa): Initiating midodrine (Option A) or droxidopa (Option E) is contraindicated or requires extreme caution because the patient already has severe supine hypertension (systolic > 180 mmHg). These drugs would worsen the SH and potentially precipitate hypertensive urgency/emergency or stroke.\n    *   Volume Expanders (Fludrocortisone): Fludrocortisone (Option D) significantly raises supine blood pressure and is generally avoided or used with caution in patients with severe SH. Continuing amlodipine is also incorrect.\n    *   No Treatment of SH (Option B): While permissive hypertension is often allowed in nOH, levels of 185/98 mmHg are high enough to drive significant pressure natriuresis and end-organ risk. Simply stopping amlodipine without addressing the nocturnal hypertension leaves the nocturia/fall mechanism active.\n    *   Short-acting Antihypertensives (Option C): Switching to a short-acting antihypertensive taken *only* at bedtime is the recommended strategy. Captopril (a short-acting ACE inhibitor) or a nitroglycerin patch are standard choices. This lowers the supine BP specifically at night, reducing pressure natriuresis and nocturia, while wearing off by morning to avoid worsening daytime orthostasis.\n\nTherefore, switching from the long-acting amlodipine to a short-acting agent like captopril at bedtime addresses both the daytime hypotension promotes volume retention, and reduces the risk of nocturnal falls derived from nocturia.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p04-002", "question": "A 3-year-old girl presents with opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome and is found to have a right adrenal neuroblastoma with favorable histology, MYCN non-amplified.

Pathophysiology (Mechanism of Hypokalemia): The hallmark of acute soluble barium poisoning (such as barium carbonate) is profound hypokalemia. Barium ions ($Ba^{2+}$) competitively block the passive potassium efflux channels (specifically the inward rectifier potassium channels) on cell membranes. Meanwhile, the $Na^{+}$-$K^{+}$-ATPase pump continues to actively transport potassium into the cells. This results in a massive intracellular shift of potassium, causing serum levels to drop precipitously. While the patient has vomiting and diarrhea (\"GI losses\"), the rapidity and severity of the hypokalemia (2.1 mEq/L) are primarily due to the intracellular sequestration, not the external loss.\n\n2.  Management (Elimination Strategy): Barium carbonate is soluble in gastric acid, allowing absorption. Barium sulfate, however, is insoluble and non-toxic (which is why it is safe for radiographic contrast). A specific decontamination strategy for barium ingestion is the administration of a soluble sulfate salt (like oral sodium sulfate or magnesium sulfate). The sulfate ions bind with the barium ions in the gastrointestinal tract to form insoluble barium sulfate, preventing further absorption and facilitating fecal elimination. While hemodialysis can remove barium and is used in severe cases with renal failure, Option A incorrectly attributes the primary mechanism to GI losses.\n\nTherefore, Option B correctly identifies both the primary physiologic mechanism and the specific antidote/elimination strategy.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p04-004", "question": "A 16-year-old girl presents with cyclic, worsening right pelvic pain for 6 months, occurring with each menses.

Given the IgG4 subclass of anti-IgLON5 antibodies (which may respond less well to IVIG/complement-modulating therapies alone and favor B-cell depletion) and the chronicity of the disease, an aggressive combination strategy comprising induction (steroids/IVIG) and maintenance (rituximab) is the therapeutic strategy most cited to provide benefit, albeit often modest.\n\nMonotherapy with steroids (A) or plasma exchange (B) typically yields only transient, if any, benefit.

Identify the Clinical Scenario: The patient has an established diagnosis of wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRwt) characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy (LV wall thickness 16 mm) and preserved to mildly reduced ejection fraction (LVEF 45%). The clinical challenge is to distinguish this echocardiographically from hypertensive heart disease (HHD), which also presents with LVH and potentially reduced strain.\n\n2.  Evaluate Strain Patterns:\n    *   Global Longitudinal Strain (GLS): In cardiac amyloidosis, GLS is typically impaired (less negative, often absolute value < 15%). However, reduced GLS is non-specific and can occur in hypertensive heart disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and ischemic disease. Therefore, Option A (GLS -8%) is consistent with amyloidosis but not the *best* specific differentiator.\n    *   Circumferential Strain: While longitudinal strain is affected early in amyloidosis, circumferential strain is often preserved until later stages. Option D is not the defining sign.\n    *   Strain Gradient/Pattern: The hallmark feature of cardiac amyloidosis on speckle-tracking echocardiography is distinct regional variation in longitudinal strain. The strain is severely impaired (low/close to zero) at the basal and mid-ventricular segments but is relatively preserved (more negative/normal) at the apex. This is known as \"Apical Sparing.\"\n\n3.  Analyze the Specific Metric (Relative Apical Sparing):\n    *   This pattern creates a \"cherry-on-top\" appearance on polar maps (bull's-eye plots).\n    *   This is quantified by the Relative Apical Sparing Ratio (RAP). A common formula derived from the seminal paper by Phelan et al. (2012) is: $\\text{Average Apical LS} / (\\text{Average Basal LS} + \\text{Average Mid LS})$.\n    *   In healthy individuals and those with hypertensive heart disease, this ratio typically sits between 0.5 and 1.0 (strain is relatively uniform or follows a physiological base-to-apex gradient).\n    *   In cardiac amyloidosis, because the base is severely affected and the apex is spared, the numerator remains high while the denominator drops, driving the ratio significantly higher. A classic cutoff for distinguishing amyloidosis from other causes of LVH is a ratio > 1.0. A ratio of > 1.5 is highly specific for amyloidosis.\n\n4.  Evaluate Other Options:\n    *   Option C (\"Basal sparing pattern\") describes the opposite of the amyloid pattern (preservation of the base), which is incorrect.\n    *   Option E (\"Longitudinal strain <10% with basal predominance\") suggests the strain (function) is predominant at the base, which is also the opposite of the apical sparing seen in amyloidosis.\n\n5.  Conclusion: The presence of relative apical sparing with a calculated ratio commonly cited (often >1.0 in literature, here >1.5 representing a strong positive finding) is the most discriminatory feature listed for separating amyloidosis from hypertensive heart disease.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p04-010", "question": "A 23-year-old graduate student has persistent fasting glucose 108-115 mg/dL and HbA1c 6.1-6.3% discovered on routine screening.

Longitudinal natural history data indicate that individuals with GCK-MODY have a very low risk of developing microvascular or macrovascular complications associated with diabetes.\n\nCrucially, the hyperglycemia in GCK-MODY is biologically defended; the body attempts to maintain glucose at this higher set point.
