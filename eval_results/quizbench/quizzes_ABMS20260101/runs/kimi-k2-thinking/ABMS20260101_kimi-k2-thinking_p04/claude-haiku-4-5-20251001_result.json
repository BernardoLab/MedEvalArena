The challenge is managing both conditions without worsening falls.\n\nAnalysis of Options:\n\nA. Discontinue amlodipine + midodrine 10 mg TID (last dose before 6 PM)\n- Removes the calcium channel blocker that may worsen orthostatic hypotension\n- Midodrine is a selective α1-agonist that increases peripheral vascular resistance\n- Dosing before 6 PM prevents nocturnal supine hypertension\n- Appropriate for NOH management\n- Addresses fall risk by improving orthostatic tolerance\n\nB. Discontinue amlodipine, avoid all antihypertensives\n- Leaves supine hypertension untreated (185/98 is significant)\n- Supine hypertension increases stroke/MI risk\n- Not appropriate management\n\nC. Switch to captopril at bedtime only\n- ACE inhibitors can worsen orthostatic hypotension\n- Single bedtime dosing doesn't adequately control daytime supine hypertension\n- Not ideal for this patient\n\nD. Add fludrocortisone + continue amlodipine\n- Fludrocortisone helps NOH but worsens supine hypertension\n- Continuing amlodipine perpetuates the problem\n- Head elevation helps but insufficient alone\n\nE. Droxidopa + discontinue amlodipine\n- Droxidopa is appropriate for NOH\n- However, droxidopa can worsen supine hypertension\n- Less ideal than midodrine for this specific scenario\n\nBest Answer:\nOption A is most appropriate because:\n1. Removes amlodipine (contributing to orthostatic hypotension)\n2. Initiates midodrine (improves orthostatic tolerance and reduces falls)\n3.

Disease characteristics: Anti-IgLON5 disease is a tauopathy-mediated autoimmune disorder with underlying neurodegeneration. The pathology involves both autoimmune and neurodegenerative components.\n\n2. Treatment evidence: Unlike many autoimmune neurological disorders, anti-IgLON5 disease has shown limited response to standard immunotherapy alone. The disease has a significant neurodegenerative component that doesn't respond well to isolated immunosuppression.\n\n3. Evidence for each option:\n   - A (High-dose methylprednisolone): Monotherapy with steroids alone has shown limited benefit\n   - B (Plasma exchange): Limited evidence for sustained benefit as monotherapy\n   - C (Rituximab monotherapy): Limited evidence as single agent\n   - D (Combined immunotherapy): Multiple case reports and small series suggest that combined immunotherapy with steroids, IVIG, and rituximab has shown the most consistent modest symptomatic benefit, particularly when started early\n   - E (Trazodone): While used symptomatically for sleep, it doesn't address the underlying autoimmune/neurodegenerative process\n\nThe literature on anti-IgLON5 disease indicates that combined immunotherapy approaches (steroids + IVIG + rituximab) have demonstrated the most modest but meaningful symptomatic benefit, particularly in early disease stages. This multimodal approach addresses both the autoimmune component and attempts to slow neurodegeneration.\n\nThe answer is D"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p04-009", "question": "A 76-year-old man with wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRwt) has LV wall thickness 16mm and LVEF 45%.

Global longitudinal strain -8% - This is reduced but not specific; both conditions can have reduced GLS\n\nB. Relative apical sparing ratio >1.5 - This is the hallmark finding that distinguishes amyloidosis from hypertensive disease. The apical sparing pattern (preserved apical strain relative to basal/mid) is characteristic of cardiac amyloidosis\n\nC. Basal sparing pattern - This is the opposite of what occurs in amyloidosis; amyloidosis shows apical sparing, not basal sparing\n\nD. Circumferential strain >-15% - Circumferential strain is less specific and doesn't distinguish these conditions well\n\nE.
