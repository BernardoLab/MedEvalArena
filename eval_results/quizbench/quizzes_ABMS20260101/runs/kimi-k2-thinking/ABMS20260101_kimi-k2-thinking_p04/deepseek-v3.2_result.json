Discontinue amlodipine and start midodrine 10 mg TID, last dose before 6 PM**  \n- Midodrine is a peripheral α1-agonist for OH, but lasts ~4 hours; giving last dose before 6 PM helps avoid evening supine hypertension.  \n- Discontinuing amlodipine removes a contributor to OH and supine HTN.  \n- However, midodrine can worsen supine HTN if taken too late; timing is important.  \n\n**B. Discontinue amlodipine and avoid all antihypertensives**  \n- Still leaves supine HTN untreated, which is risky for cardiovascular/renal outcomes.  \n- Not ideal because supine HTN itself can cause nocturnal natriuresis → worse morning OH.  \n\n**C. Switch amlodipine to short-acting captopril at bedtime only**  \n- Bedtime ACEi can reduce nocturnal HTN without worsening daytime OH.  \n- But captopril TID is usually used for HTN; once at bedtime might not control daytime supine HTN well, but main goal here is to lower nocturnal BP to reduce morning OH.  \n- This is a recognized strategy in autonomic failure with supine HTN.  \n\n**D. Add fludrocortisone and continue amlodipine, elevate head of bed**  \n- Fludrocortisone expands volume, helps OH but worsens supine HTN and can cause edema, heart failure, hypokalemia; risky in elderly with CKD.  \n- Continuing amlodipine still adds to OH and supine HTN.  \n- Head elevation helps nocturnal HTN but not enough.  \n\n**E. Initiate droxidopa and discontinue amlodipine**  \n- Droxidopa (norepinephrine prodrug) for neurogenic OH; can also worsen supine HTN.  \n- Requires careful dosing timing (last dose by late afternoon).  \n- But droxidopa is especially used in Parkinson’s/Hypotension, though not clearly better than midodrine here; also, supine HTN management not directly addressed except by stopping amlodipine.  \n\n---\n\n**Best approach in neurogenic OH with supine HTN:**  \n1. Remove long-acting vasodilators (amlodipine) → correct.  \n2. Treat OH with short-acting pressor agent (midodrine or droxidopa) timed to avoid evening supine HTN.  \n3. For supine HTN, use bedtime short-acting antihypertensive (e.g., captopril, losartan) to reduce nocturnal HTN → reduces pressure natriuresis → improves morning OH.  \n\nOption **C** addresses supine HTN directly with bedtime captopril and removes amlodipine, but does not add a drug for daytime OH (though stopping amlodipine may improve OH slightly). However, patient has symptomatic OH → likely still needs pressor agent.  \n\nOption **A** treats OH but does nothing for supine HTN except stopping amlodipine and timing midodrine early. Supine HTN may remain problematic.  \n\nIn practice, guidelines for neurogenic OH + supine HTN often recommend:  \n- Non-pharmacologic (head-up tilt at night, salt/water).  \n- If needed, add short-acting antihypertensive at bedtime (e.g., captopril, losartan, clonidine patch).  \n- For daytime OH, use midodrine or droxidopa.  \n\nGiven the options, **C** is the only one that directly targets nocturnal HTN with a short-acting agent at bedtime, which can reduce morning OH and falls, while stopping amlodipine helps daytime OH. The patient’s recurrent nocturnal falls may be due to nocturnal HTN → nocturia → getting up with OH.  \n\nThus, **C** is the most appropriate next step.  \n\n---\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p04-002", "question": "A 3-year-old girl presents with opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome and is found to have a right adrenal neuroblastoma with favorable histology, MYCN non-amplified.
