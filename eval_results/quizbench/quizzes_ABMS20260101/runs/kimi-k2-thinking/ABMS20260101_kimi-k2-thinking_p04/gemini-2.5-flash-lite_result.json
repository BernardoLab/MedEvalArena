She is frail, elderly, and has Parkinson disease and CKD. The management must address both the high supine blood pressure, which carries cardiovascular risk, and the orthostatic hypotension, which impairs function and causes falls.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA.  Discontinue amlodipine (reasonable to address supine hypertension) and initiate midodrine 10 mg three times daily, with last dose before 6 PM (treats NOH; the timing is crucial to mitigate worsening supine hypertension). While 10 mg TID is a high starting dose for a frail elderly patient, the specific timing instruction is a critical component of managing midodrine in the presence of supine hypertension.\n\nB.  Discontinue amlodipine and avoid all antihypertensive therapy given fall risk. This would ignore the dangerously high supine hypertension (185/98 mmHg), which is inappropriate.\n\nC.  Switch amlodipine to short-acting captopril 12.5 mg at bedtime only. A single bedtime dose of a short-acting agent is unlikely to adequately control supine hypertension throughout the day or effectively treat NOH. It may also lead to unpredictable blood pressure fluctuations.\n\nD.  Add fludrocortisone 0.1 mg daily and continue amlodipine, elevating head of bed 30°. Continuing amlodipine while the supine BP is 185/98 mmHg is problematic. Fludrocortisone can also increase supine hypertension due to fluid retention and increased vascular tone, making this option potentially risky for the supine hypertension, despite it being a standard agent for NOH.\n\nE.  Initiate droxidopa 100 mg three times daily and discontinue amlodipine. Discontinuing amlodipine addresses the supine hypertension. Droxidopa is an appropriate agent for NOH, especially in Parkinson disease, and 100 mg TID is a standard starting dose. However, it, like midodrine, can worsen supine hypertension. The option does not include specific timing instructions, which are crucial for managing supine hypertension when using vasopressors for NOH.\n\nComparing options A and E, both propose discontinuing amlodipine and adding a medication for NOH. Option A's explicit instruction for timed dosing of midodrine (\"last dose before 6 PM\") is a critical maneuver to minimize the risk of worsening supine hypertension, a significant concern in this patient. While the starting dose of midodrine in option A is high, the detailed strategy for managing the interaction between NOH treatment and supine hypertension makes it the most comprehensive and appropriate next step compared to option E, which omits this crucial timing detail.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p04-002", "question": "A 3-year-old girl presents with opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome and is found to have a right adrenal neuroblastoma with favorable histology, MYCN non-amplified.

Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the CD20 antigen found on B-cells. By depleting these B-cells, it directly interferes with antibody production responsible for autoimmune pathogenesis. This aligns precisely with the question's requirement for targeting \"specific B-cell mediated pathogenesis.\" The dosage and frequency (375 mg/m² weekly for 4 weeks) are standard for Rituximab induction.\n\nB.

Barium ions are known to cause hypokalemia through several mechanisms, primarily by interfering with potassium transport across cell membranes. A key mechanism is the blockage of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels, which can lead to increased influx of potassium into cells, thus decreasing serum potassium levels. This intracellular shift explains the profound muscle weakness, as potassium is crucial for muscle function.\n\nThe most effective immediate strategy for managing ingested toxins like barium is decontamination of the gastrointestinal tract to prevent further absorption. Oral administration of sulfate salts, such as sodium sulfate, is recommended because barium sulfate (BaSO4) is highly insoluble and poorly absorbed. This precipitates any soluble barium present in the gut, facilitating its elimination.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\nA. GI losses; emergent hemodialysis: While GI losses contribute to hypokalemia, they are a consequence of the poisoning, not the primary direct mechanism of the toxin on cellular potassium. Emergent hemodialysis is usually reserved for hyperkalemia or specific toxicities, not the primary strategy for barium ingestion in this context.\nB. Intracellular shift via K+ channel blockade; oral sodium sulfate: This option describes a recognized mechanism of barium-induced hypokalemia (intracellular shift due to K+ channel blockade) and the most effective gastrointestinal decontamination strategy (oral sodium sulfate).\nC. Renal tubular wasting; potassium-sparing diuretics: Renal tubular wasting is not the primary mechanism for acute barium poisoning. Potassium-sparing diuretics would increase, not decrease, serum potassium and are thus inappropriate.\nD. Beta-agonist effect; beta-blockade therapy: Barium does not mimic beta-agonists. Beta-blockade therapy would potentially worsen hypokalemia if there were a beta-agonist effect, which is not the case here, and is not a treatment for barium poisoning.\nE. Insulin-mediated shift; IV insulin with glucose: Insulin promotes potassium influx into cells, causing hypokalemia, but barium does not primarily induce an insulin-mediated shift. IV insulin with glucose is used to treat hyperkalemia, not to address the cause of hypokalemia from barium ingestion, nor is it an elimination strategy for the toxin.\n\nTherefore, option B provides both the most plausible primary mechanism of hypokalemia caused by barium carbonate ingestion and the most effective elimination strategy.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p04-004", "question": "A 16-year-old girl presents with cyclic, worsening right pelvic pain for 6 months, occurring with each menses.

Grade A POPF requires no modification to standard postoperative care, which typically involves continued drain management and clinical observation.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. Remove the drain: This would be premature. The drain is monitoring for pancreatic fluid leakage, and with a confirmed POPF, it should remain in place until output is minimal and no longer amylase-rich.\nB.

Keep the drain and discharge to home: Discharging a patient with a confirmed POPF, even if Grade A, is generally not advisable at postoperative day 3, especially before further characterization of the fistula. Readiness for discharge is usually assessed after drain removal or significant reduction in output attributed to stable healing.\nE. Return to operating room for exploration: Surgical re-exploration is indicated for significant complications such as peritonitis, hemodynamic instability, high-output fistula unresponsive to conservative measures, or worsening clinical status. This patient is clinically stable, making immediate surgical exploration unwarranted.\n\nConsidering the elevated drain fluid amylase, even in a clinically stable patient, obtaining a contrast-enhanced CT scan is the most appropriate next step to fully evaluate the pancreatic fistula, confirm its characteristics, and guide ongoing or future management decisions.

This results in a characteristic pattern of relative apical sparing of longitudinal strain. Global longitudinal strain (GLS) is usually reduced, but the pattern is key.\n\n*   Hypertensive Heart Disease: Chronic hypertension leads to left ventricular hypertrophy. In the early stages, contractility might be preserved. As the disease progresses, fibrosis can develop, leading to reduced strain. The strain reduction in hypertensive heart disease is often more homogeneous or may show basal predominance in some phases, rather than apical sparing.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n*   A. Global longitudinal strain -8%: A GLS of -8% indicates significant systolic dysfunction. Both ATTRwt and advanced hypertensive heart disease can present with reduced GLS. This finding alone is not specific enough to differentiate the two.\n\n*   B. Relative apical sparing ratio >1.5: This describes the pattern of longitudinal strain. A ratio greater than 1.5 implies that the apical segments have significantly better (less negative) longitudinal strain compared to the basal or mid-ventricular segments. This pattern of relative apical sparing is a well-recognized and highly characteristic feature of ATTR amyloidosis. This is a strong differentiating factor.\n\n*   C. Basal sparing pattern: This pattern is the opposite of what is typically seen in ATTRwt. Basal sparing is not a characteristic feature that distinguishes ATTRwt from hypertensive heart disease.\n\n*   D. Circumferential strain >-15%: This statement is somewhat ambiguous as it doesn't explicitly state \"global\" or \"regional\" or a specific pattern. If it refers to global circumferential strain (GCS), GCS values more negative than -15% (e.g., -18% or -20%) represent normal to mildly reduced circumferential function. Values less negative than -15% (e.g., -10% or -12%) indicate impaired circumferential strain. Reduced GCS can be seen in both conditions. However, the pattern of longitudinal strain is generally considered more distinctive for differentiating ATTR from hypertensive heart disease.\n\n*   E. Longitudinal strain <10% with basal predominance: Assuming \"longitudinal strain <10%\" means a value less negative than -10% (e.g., -5% or -8%), this suggests preserved strain in those segments. However, if it implies strain *more negative* than -10% with basal predominance, it describes a pattern (basal predominance) that is not typical of ATTRwt and can be seen in conditions like hypertensive heart disease. This option is the opposite of the characteristic ATTR finding. The phrase \"longitudinal strain <10%\" is also potentially confusing if not specified as negative percentages. If it means a value *less negative* than -10%, it suggests preservation, not typical ATTR pattern.\n\nConsidering the options, the relative apical apical sparing ratio is the most specific and characteristic speckle-tracking finding that helps distinguish ATTRwt from hypertensive heart disease.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_kimi-k2-thinking_p04-010", "question": "A 23-year-old graduate student has persistent fasting glucose 108-115 mg/dL and HbA1c 6.1-6.3% discovered on routine screening.

The patient is young (23 years old), has a normal BMI, negative islet autoantibodies (ruling out type 1 diabetes and LADA), and a family history of mild hyperglycemia. The identification of a heterozygous GCK pathogenic variant is highly suggestive of maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 2 (MODY2).\n\nGCK mutations typically impair the function of glucokinase, an enzyme crucial for glucose sensing by pancreatic beta-cells and hepatocytes. In heterozygous pathogenic variants, this leads to a mild, stable, and often asymptomatic hyperglycemia that is present from birth or early childhood and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Longitudinal natural history data for MODY2 indicates that this condition is generally benign, with a very low risk of microvascular or macrovascular complications, even with glucose and HbA1c levels in the ranges observed. Therefore, pharmacologic treatment is typically not indicated, and management focuses on genetic counseling, education, and monitoring.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. Metformin 500 mg twice daily: Metformin primarily reduces hepatic glucose production and improves insulin sensitivity. It is not indicated for MODY2, as the primary defect is impaired glucose sensing, not insulin resistance or overt insulin deficiency.\nB. Glipizide 5 mg daily: Glipizide is a sulfonylurea that stimulates insulin secretion. While it might increase insulin release, it is often ineffective in significantly lowering glucose in MODY2 due to the altered glucose threshold for beta-cell function. Furthermore, it carries a risk of hypoglycemia, which is undesirable as the hyperglycemia in MODY2 is mild and typically not associated with symptoms or complications.\nC. Sitagliptin 100 mg daily: Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor that enhances incretin-mediated insulin secretion. Similar to sulfonylureas, its effectiveness in significantly altering the course of MODY2 is not established, and it's not the standard of care given the benign natural history.\nD. No pharmacologic therapy: This strategy is supported by extensive natural history data for MODY2. The mild hyperglycemia is well-tolerated, and complications are rare. Management typically involves monitoring and education.\nE. Basal insulin 0.2 units/kg: Insulin therapy is reserved for conditions with significant insulin deficiency or severe insulin resistance leading to symptomatic hyperglycemia and complications, such as type 1 diabetes or advanced type 2 diabetes. This is not appropriate for MODY2.\n\nThe single best management strategy supported by longitudinal natural history data for a patient with a heterozygous GCK pathogenic variant consistent with MODY2 is no pharmacologic therapy.\n\nThe answer is (D)"}]
