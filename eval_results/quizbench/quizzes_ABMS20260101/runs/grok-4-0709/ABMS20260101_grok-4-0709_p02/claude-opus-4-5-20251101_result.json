The RLN has different fascicular organization, and viral neuritis can preferentially affect certain nerve fibers.

This is likely a technical problem with the anastomosis (anastomotic stenosis) causing turbulent, high-velocity flow, which led to the graft thrombosis.\n\nEvaluating Options:\n\nA. Systemic thrombolysis with alteplase - This is only 3 days post-surgery, so thrombolysis carries significant bleeding risk at the surgical site. Also, it doesn't address the underlying technical problem (anastomotic stenosis).\n\nB. Surgical thrombectomy and anastomosis revision - This addresses both issues: removes the thrombus AND corrects the underlying technical problem at the distal anastomosis. Given this is an early graft failure with an identifiable technical cause, surgical revision is appropriate.\n\nC. Endovascular stent placement - Could address stenosis but doesn't deal with the thrombosed graft effectively, and placing a stent at an anastomosis is generally not ideal.\n\nD. Anticoagulation with heparin alone - Won't restore flow in a thrombosed graft and doesn't address the anastomotic problem.\n\nE. Balloon angioplasty of the native vessel - The problem is at the anastomosis, not the native vessel. This doesn't address the graft thrombosis or the anastomotic stenosis.\n\nConclusion:\nEarly graft thrombosis (within days of surgery) with evidence of a technical problem (anastomotic stenosis causing high-velocity flow) requires surgical intervention to both remove the clot and revise the problematic anastomosis.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p02", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p02-010", "question": "A 65-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis develops shortness of breath.

Severity and Mechanism: Severe MR with a flail leaflet indicates structural damage (likely ruptured chordae), which is a degenerative/primary MR that requires intervention.\n\n2. Indications for Surgery: \n   - Severe MR with symptoms (shortness of breath)\n   - Elevated pulmonary pressures (indicates hemodynamic consequences)\n   - These are Class I indications for intervention\n\n3. Choice of Intervention:\n\n   Option A - Mitral valve repair: This is the gold standard for degenerative MR with flail leaflet. Repair is preferred over replacement when feasible because it:\n   - Preserves native valve tissue\n   - Has better long-term outcomes\n   - Avoids anticoagulation\n   - Has lower operative mortality\n   - Flail leaflet is typically very amenable to repair\n\n   Option B - Bioprosthetic replacement: Second-line if repair is not feasible\n\n   Option C - Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (MitraClip): Reserved for high surgical risk patients.

RA alone doesn't preclude surgical repair.\n\nThe patient is symptomatic with severe MR, preserved LV function, and a repairable lesion (flail leaflet). Surgical mitral valve repair is the most appropriate intervention.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}]
