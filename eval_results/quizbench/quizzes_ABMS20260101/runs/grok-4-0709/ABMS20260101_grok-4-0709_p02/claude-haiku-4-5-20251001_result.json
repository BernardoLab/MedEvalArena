EMG shows: denervation of posterior cricoarytenoid muscles BUT preserved thyroarytenoid activity\n4. Progressive dysphonia and stridor\n\nAnatomical Considerations:\n\nThe posterior cricoarytenoid (PCA) muscle is the ONLY abductor of the vocal cords and is innervated by the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN).\n\nThe thyroarytenoid muscle is innervated by the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) as well.\n\nThe superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) innervates the cricothyroid muscle.\n\nAnalysis of the EMG Finding:\n\nThe critical finding is that the PCA is denervated while thyroarytenoid is preserved. This is unusual because both are typically innervated by the RLN.\n\nHowever, this pattern suggests selective denervation of the motor branches to the PCA while sparing other RLN branches. This can occur with:\n- Selective RLN injury affecting primarily the abductor fibers\n- Viral neuritis affecting specific nerve fibers\n\nDifferential Analysis:\n\nA. Bilateral RLN palsy from viral neuritis - This fits perfectly. Viral neuritis can cause selective denervation of specific motor fibers within the RLN, particularly affecting the PCA (abductor) fibers while sparing other branches. The recent URI supports viral etiology. Bilateral involvement explains the narrow glottic aperture (both cords in paramedian position).\n\nB. Cricoarytenoid joint fixation - Would show mechanical restriction, not denervation on EMG.\n\nC. Paradoxical vocal fold motion - Functional disorder, not denervation.\n\nD.

The absent sympathetic skin response and minimal heart rate response indicate impaired sympathetic nervous system function. The orthostatic hypotension reflects inability to maintain peripheral vasoconstriction when upright.\n\nAnalysis of Options:\n\nA. Midodrine - Direct-acting alpha-1 adrenergic agonist that causes peripheral vasoconstriction. Works peripherally, doesn't require intact sympathetic nervous system.

Direct compression of the AV node - The AV node is located in the AV nodal region, but the bundle of His (which is more relevant here) runs through the membranous septum just below the aortic valve. A low-positioned prosthesis could compress this.\n\nB. Inflammation of the bundle of His - Inflammation would develop over time, not acutely intraoperatively.\n\nC. Ischemia from coronary ostial obstruction - This would cause acute coronary syndrome/MI, not specifically complete heart block.\n\nD. Mechanical trauma to the membranous septum - A low-positioned prosthesis can directly traumatize or compress the membranous septum where the bundle of His runs. This is the most direct mechanical explanation for acute complete heart block during the procedure.\n\nE.

This suggests:\n- Stenosis at the distal anastomosis\n- Likely due to intimal hyperplasia or technical issue (anastomotic stenosis)\n- This creates turbulent, high-velocity flow\n- The stenosis led to graft thrombosis\n\nWhy Early Graft Thrombosis Occurs:\nEarly thrombosis (within 30 days) is typically due to:\n1. Technical error (most common)\n2. Anastomotic stenosis\n3. Poor runoff\n4. Inadequate anticoagulation\n\nEvaluation of Options:\n\nA. Systemic thrombolysis - Not ideal for early graft thrombosis with identified anatomic problem; doesn't address the underlying stenosis\n\nB. Surgical thrombectomy and anastomosis revision - This is the gold standard for early graft thrombosis, especially when there's an identifiable technical problem (anastomotic stenosis causing high-velocity flow). The graft needs to be cleared and the anastomosis revised.\n\nC. Endovascular stent placement - Could be considered but surgical revision is more definitive for this early complication with clear anatomic problem\n\nD. Anticoagulation alone - Insufficient; doesn't address the mechanical problem\n\nE.
