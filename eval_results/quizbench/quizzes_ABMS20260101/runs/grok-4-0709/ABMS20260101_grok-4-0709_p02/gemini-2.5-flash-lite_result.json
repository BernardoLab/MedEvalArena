Hydroxychloroquine is a standard first-line therapy for SCLE; persistence of lesions despite this treatment indicates the need for adjunctive therapy.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. Thalidomide: Thalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent that can be effective in treating refractory cutaneous lupus, including SCLE. However, it carries significant risks, including teratogenicity, neuropathy, and sedation, making it a choice often reserved for severe or recalcitrant cases.\n\nB. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF): MMF is an immunosuppressant that has demonstrated efficacy in various forms of cutaneous lupus, including SCLE that is refractory to hydroxychloroquine. It is often considered a preferred adjunctive therapy due to its effectiveness and generally better tolerability and safety profile for long-term use compared to thalidomide.\n\nC. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG): IVIG is typically used for more severe or life-threatening manifestations of lupus, such as bullous lupus or severe systemic involvement, rather than chronic SCLE refractory to first-line therapy.\n\nD. Lenalidomide: Lenalidomide is a thalidomide analog and also has immunomodulatory properties. While it can be used for cutaneous lupus, MMF or thalidomide are more commonly cited as standard next steps for SCLE refractory to hydroxychloroquine.\n\nE. Apremilast: Apremilast is a phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor approved for conditions like psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Its efficacy in SCLE is not well-established, and it is not a standard treatment option for this condition.\n\nComparing the most plausible options (Thalidomide and Mycophenolate mofetil), Mycophenolate mofetil is generally considered a safer and effective next step for SCLE refractory to hydroxychloroquine for chronic management.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p02", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p02-002", "question": "A 55-year-old man with prostate cancer on androgen deprivation therapy develops urinary retention.

Transurethral incision of the bladder neck (TUIBN): This is a surgical procedure that involves cutting into the bladder neck tissue externally and/or internally to widen the opening. It is a recognized treatment for bladder neck contractures and aims for definitive relief by releasing the fibrotic tissue.\n\nB. Suprapubic catheter placement: This is a method of bypassing the bladder outlet obstruction by placing a catheter directly into the bladder through the abdominal wall. While it effectively manages urinary retention, it does not treat the underlying contracture; it is a palliative or alternative drainage method, not a definitive treatment.\n\nC. Alpha-blocker therapy: Alpha-blockers relax the smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck. They are often used for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or mild bladder outlet obstruction symptoms. However, for a fibrotic bladder neck contracture, alpha-blockers are generally not effective as the obstruction is due to fixed scar tissue, not primarily smooth muscle tone.\n\nD. Intravesical botulinum toxin injection: Botulinum toxin is used to inhibit muscle activity. It is primarily used for conditions involving detrusor overactivity or detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia. It is not indicated for the treatment of fibrotic bladder neck contracture.\n\nE. Urethral dilation with sounds: Urethral dilation involves stretching the contracted passage with progressively larger dilators. While it can provide temporary improvement, bladder neck contractures, especially if fibrotic, often have a high recurrence rate after dilation alone. It is less likely to be the \"most effective definitive\" treatment compared to surgical intervention.\n\nConsidering the options, surgical intervention to open the contracted bladder neck is the most definitive treatment. Transurethral incision of the bladder neck is a direct surgical approach to address this issue.

The upper respiratory infection history is a significant clue. The EMG findings are critical: denervation of the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles but preserved thyroarytenoid activity.\n\nLet's analyze the muscle functions and their innervation:\n1.  Posterior cricoarytenoid muscles: These are the primary abductors of the vocal cords, responsible for opening the glottis during breathing. Their denervation would lead to the inability to abduct the vocal cords, causing stridor and a narrow glottic aperture, as observed.\n2.  Thyroarytenoid muscles: These are part of the vocalis muscle, which shorten and relax the vocal cords, playing a role in adduction and fine-tuning pitch. Preservation of their activity suggests that vocal cord closure for phonation might still be partially possible, although full phonation is affected by their relationship with the abductors.\n\nBoth the posterior cricoarytenoid and thyroarytenoid muscles are innervated by the recurrent laryngeal nerve.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options:\n\nA.  Bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy due to viral neuritis: This fits the EMG findings perfectly. Unilateral or bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy causes vocal cord immobility. Denervation of the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles by RLN palsy would explain the failure of abduction and the resulting stridor and narrow glottic aperture. Viral neuritis is a common cause of isolated laryngeal nerve palsies, often following viral infections like URIs. The preserved thyroarytenoid activity could indicate the denervation is not complete or is more pronounced in the abductor fibers.\n\nB.  Cricoarytenoid joint fixation from rheumatoid arthritis: Rheumatoid arthritis can cause joint inflammation and fixation, leading to vocal cord immobility. However, this is a mechanical problem, not a neurological one. EMG would not show denervation in such cases.\n\nC.  Paradoxical vocal fold motion disorder (PVFMD): PVFMD is characterized by inappropriate adduction of the vocal cords during breathing, typically inhalation. While it can cause stridor, it's a functional disorder with dynamic movement abnormalities, not fixed immobility with denervation seen on EMG. The vocal cords are usually normal at rest.\n\nD.  Bilateral superior laryngeal nerve injury: The superior laryngeal nerve innervates the cricothyroid muscle, which tenses the vocal cords and is responsible for pitch changes. It does not innervate the posterior cricoarytenoid or thyroarytenoid muscles. Therefore, injury to the SLN would not cause the observed denervation pattern or vocal cord immobility affecting abduction.\n\nE.  Interarytenoid scarring from intubation trauma: Scarring in the interarytenoid region can cause voice changes and airway obstruction, often leading to fixed adduction. This is a structural issue, not a neurological one, and EMG would not be expected to show denervation of the intrinsic laryngeal muscles. Specifically, it wouldn't directly cause denervation of the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles.\n\nBased on the symptoms, laryngoscopy findings, and crucial EMG results showing denervation of the abductor muscles (posterior cricoarytenoid) following a URI, bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy due to viral neuritis is the most likely diagnosis.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p02", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p02-004", "question": "A 62-year-old woman with incomplete tetraplegia from a C5 spinal cord injury undergoes inpatient rehabilitation.

The minimal heart rate increase further suggests a blunted baroreceptor reflex response. The goal is to increase peripheral vascular tone to maintain blood pressure in the upright position.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\nA. Midodrine: This is an alpha-1 adrenergic agonist. It causes peripheral vasoconstriction by acting on alpha-1 receptors in blood vessels, which helps to raise blood pressure and improve orthostatic tolerance. It is a first-line pharmacologic treatment for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension.\nB. Fludrocortisone: This is a mineralocorticoid that increases salt and water retention, thereby increasing blood volume. Increased blood volume can help support blood pressure in the upright position. It is also a first-line treatment for orthostatic hypotension, particularly when volume depletion contributes.\nC. Propranolol: This is a beta-blocker that can blunt the reflex tachycardia that normally occurs in response to a drop in blood pressure. Using a beta-blocker in orthostatic hypotension, especially neurogenic orthostatic hypotension where compensatory tachycardia is already limited, can worsen the condition.\nD. Clonidine: This is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that acts centrally to reduce sympathetic outflow from the brain. This typically leads to a decrease in blood pressure, making it inappropriate for treating orthostatic hypotension.\nE. Ephedrine: This is a sympathomimetic amine with both alpha and beta effects. While it can increase heart rate and blood pressure, it is generally less preferred than midodrine for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension due to potential cardiac side effects and less predictable effects compared to midodrine's selective alpha-1 agonism.\n\nBoth midodrine and fludrocortisone are considered effective first-line agents for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. However, given the impaired sympathetic vasoconstriction observed in this patient (as evidenced by absent sympathetic skin response), a direct vasoconstrictor like midodrine is particularly well-suited to address the underlying pathophysiology.

Administration of systemic heparin: Heparin is an anticoagulant and mainly used to prevent or treat thrombus formation. It will not resolve mechanical obstruction like a kink or twist in the venous pedicle, which is a common cause of venous congestion in free flaps.\nB. Leech therapy to the flap: Leech therapy can be a temporizing measure or an adjunct treatment for venous congestion by creating a diversion of venous blood.

Surgical exploration and vein reanastomosis: This is the most appropriate immediate intervention. Signs of venous congestion in a free flap indicate critical compromise. Surgical exploration allows for examination of the pedicle, identification of the cause of venous obstruction (e.g., twist, kink, compression, thrombus at the anastomosis), and direct intervention to correct it, such as revision of the venous anastomosis. This is the most likely option to salvage the flap.\nD. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is used to improve tissue oxygenation in compromised tissues.

However, their efficacy for significant venous congestion caused by mechanical obstruction is limited, and they are not a substitute for surgical correction.\n\nGiven the signs of venous congestion and the potential for mechanical obstruction in a free flap, prompt surgical assessment and revision of the venous anastomosis is the most appropriate and urgent intervention.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p02", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p02-006", "question": "A 55-year-old man with a history of pituitary macroadenoma resection presents with acute headache, vision loss, and hypotension.

Radiation-induced lung injury with fibrosis: This option directly addresses the observed pathology. Radiation therapy damages lung tissue, leading to inflammation (pneumonitis) which can resolve or progress to chronic changes including fibrosis, architectural distortion, and traction bronchiectasis. The timeline of six months and the imaging findings of established fibrosis and traction bronchiectasis align perfectly with this description. This represents the chronic sequela of radiation lung injury.\n\nD. Secondary malignancy: Malignancies arising after radiation therapy typically take many years to develop and would present as a new tumor, not as fibrosis.\n\nE. Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD): This is a vascular condition and is not a typical direct complication of radiation therapy to the lung parenchyma in this manner.\n\nGiven the findings of fibrosis and traction bronchiectasis at six months post-radiation therapy, radiation-induced lung injury with fibrosis (the chronic stage) is the most likely complication. Radiation pneumonitis is the acute phase, which can lead to fibrosis, but the described imaging findings point to the established fibrotic change.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p02", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p02-008", "question": "A 72-year-old man with severe aortic stenosis undergoes transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

This clinical presentation points to a mechanical complication related to the valve's implantation depth.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\nA. Direct compression of the atrioventricular node: The AV node is located in the posteroinferior aspect of the interatrial septum, near the junction with the interventricular septum, and is in close proximity to the aortic annulus. A prosthesis deployed too low in the LVOT can exert direct pressure on the AV node, impairing or blocking conduction from the atria to the ventricles, leading to heart block. This is a well-established complication of TAVR, particularly with deeper implantation.\n\nB. Inflammation of the bundle of His: While inflammation can occur post-procedure, it is generally considered a secondary complication rather than the primary mechanism for acute complete heart block immediately after valve deployment. Direct mechanical forces are more likely to cause immediate conduction disturbances.\n\nC. Ischemia from coronary ostial obstruction: If the prosthesis obstructs the coronary ostia, it can lead to myocardial ischemia. However, the primary symptoms of ischemia are chest pain and LV dysfunction, not typically complete heart block as the first manifestation. While ischemia can affect conduction, direct mechanical compression is a more direct cause for AV block related to valve position.\n\nD. Mechanical trauma to the membranous septum: The bundle of His traverses the inferior border of the membranous septum. Mechanical trauma to this area could certainly disrupt conduction. However, the AV node is a crucial structure located just superior to the membranous septum. Compression of the AV node itself is often cited as the most direct cause of AV block, and a low-positioned prosthesis is prone to impinging on this area. While related, direct compression of the AV node (A) is often considered the primary vulnerability.\n\nE. Calcific extension into the conduction system: While the native aortic valve was calcific, and some calcium might be displaced, the most likely mechanism from a *low-positioned prosthesis* is actual mechanical compression or trauma, not extension of calcification causing the block.\n\nConsidering the low implantation depth as the key factor, direct mechanical pressure on the structures responsible for AV conduction is the most plausible mechanism. The AV node is a critical component whose compression directly leads to AV block. Many studies and clinical observations identify compression of the AV node or bundle of His as the leading cause of heart block following TAVR, particularly with low valve deployment. Of the options provided, direct compression of the AV node is the most precise and commonly cited immediate mechanism for severe conduction disturbances like complete heart block in this context.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p02", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p02-009", "question": "A 58-year-old woman with critical limb ischemia and occluded superficial femoral artery undergoes femoropopliteal bypass with polytetrafluoroethylene graft.

Systemic thrombolysis with alteplase: While thrombolysis can be used for graft occlusion, it is less effective for early graft failure when there is a mechanical cause like significant stenosis at the anastomosis. It also carries systemic bleeding risks and does not address the underlying stenosis, leading to a high risk of re-thrombosis.\nB. Surgical thrombectomy and anastomosis revision: This option directly addresses both problems: removing the clot (thrombectomy) and correcting the identified stenosis at the distal anastomosis (revision). Surgical revision allows for direct visualization and restoration of a patent and well-constructed junction, which is often the most durable solution for early graft failure due to anastomotic stenosis.\nC. Endovascular stent placement: While endovascular techniques can treat stenosis, stenting an ePTFE graft, especially at an anastomosis, can be challenging and may lead to complications like pseudoaneurysms or stent fractures. In cases of high-velocity flow indicating significant stenosis at the anastomosis, open surgical revision is often preferred for optimal results in the early postoperative period.\nD.

For patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation and a flail leaflet who are candidates for surgery, mitral valve repair is preferred over replacement, provided that a durable repair can be performed by an experienced surgeon.

Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER): This is typically reserved for patients with severe mitral regurgitation who are at high surgical risk or for whom surgical repair or replacement is not feasible.

Afterload reduction can help reduce the regurgitant volume but does not correct the valve pathology.\nE.
