This is no longer NSCLC - it's now SCLC.\n\nEvaluating Each Option:\n\nA. Continue osimertinib with added chemotherapy\n- Osimertinib targets EGFR mutations in NSCLC\n- SCLC has different biology and is not typically EGFR-driven\n- Not appropriate for SCLC\n\nB. Switch to amivantamab\n- Amivantamab is for EGFR exon 20 insertions in NSCLC\n- Not indicated for SCLC transformation\n- Wrong histology\n\nC. Initiate etoposide and platinum-based chemotherapy\n- This is the standard first-line treatment for extensive-stage SCLC\n- Etoposide + cisplatin or carboplatin is the classic regimen\n- Appropriate for a patient with good performance status and SCLC\n- This represents a paradigm shift in treatment approach\n\nD. Use mobocertinib as targeted therapy\n- Mobocertinib is for EGFR exon 20 insertions in NSCLC\n- Not appropriate for SCLC\n\nE. Administer immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy\n- While immunotherapy has a role in SCLC, it's typically combined with chemotherapy\n- Monotherapy is not standard first-line\n\nConclusion:\n\nHistologic transformation to SCLC requires a complete change in treatment strategy.
