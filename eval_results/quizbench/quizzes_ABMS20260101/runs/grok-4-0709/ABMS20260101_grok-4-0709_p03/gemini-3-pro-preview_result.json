Damage to the neurohypophysis or pituitary stalk during surgery disrupts the secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin.\n\nThe hallmarks of central DI demonstrated here are:\n1.  Polyuria: Excessive urine output (exceeding 10 L/day).\n2.  Hypernatremia: A serum sodium level of 152 mEq/L, resulting from the excretion of large volumes of dilute urine (free water loss) that exceeds fluid intake.\n\nAnalysis of the options:\n*   A. Desmopressin acetate (DDAVP): This is the synthetic analog of ADH and is the standard pharmacological treatment for central diabetes insipidus. It acts on renal collecting ducts to increase water reabsorption, reducing urine output and normalizing serum sodium.\n*   B. Fluid restriction: This is the treatment for SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate ADH). Doing this in a patient with DI who is already hypernatremic and dehydrated would be dangerous and could lead to severe hypernatremia and vascular collapse.\n*   C. Hypertonic saline infusion: This is used for symptomatic *hyponatremia*. Giving sodium to a patient who is already hypernatremic (Na 152 mEq/L) would be detrimental.\n*   D. Demeclocycline: This drug antagonizes the effect of ADH on the kidney and is used to treat chronic SIADH. It would worsen DI.\n*   E. Vasopressin infusion: While vasopressin is the missing hormone, desmopressin is preferred for DI because it has a longer duration of action and lacks the strong vasoconstrictive (pressor) effects of vasopressin. Vasopressin infusion is typically reserved for hemodynamic support (e.g., septic shock).\n\nDesmopressin is the most appropriate specific therapy to correct the hormonal deficiency.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p03", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p03-002", "question": "A 50-year-old man with cirrhosis presents with massive hematemesis.

This constellation of findings is diagnostic of sinistral (left-sided) portal hypertension (also known as segmental or regional portal hypertension).\n\n1.  Pathophysiology: Thrombus in the splenic vein obstructs the normal venous outflow from the spleen. Blood flow is diverted through the short gastric veins towards the gastric fundus, causing isolated gastric varices, and then drains into the portal system or systemic circulation. This creates high pressure in the gastric venous bed specifically, regardless of the pressure in the rest of the portal system.\n2.  Management:\n    *   Splenectomy (D): This is the definitive and curative treatment for sinistral portal hypertension. By removing the spleen, the arterial inflow driving the high pressure in the collateral gastric veins is eliminated. While the patient has cirrhosis (which increases surgical risk), the specific anatomical cause of the bleeding (SVT) makes splenectomy the most appropriate *definitive* management for the varices caused by this mechanism.\n    *   Endoscopic band ligation (A): This is the treatment of choice for esophageal varices. It is not recommended for gastric fundal varices due to their size and mucosal thickness; obturation with cyanoacrylate (glue) would be the endoscopic choice, but it is not listed, and banding is incorrect.\n    *   TIPS (B): TIPS reduces generalized portal pressure but is often ineffective for sinistral portal hypertension because the hypertension is segmental (upstream of the portal vein). Lowering portal pressure does not relieve the obstruction in the splenic vein.\n    *   BRTO (C): BRTO blocks the drainage of the gastric varices (usually a gastrorenal shunt). In the setting of SVT, the varices are the primary outflow for the spleen. blocking them without removing the spleen can lead to splenic congestion, infarction, or rupture.\n    *   Beta-blockers (E): These are used for secondary prophylaxis of esophageal varices but are not the definitive management for massive active bleeding or this specific anatomical problem.\n\nTherefore, splenectomy is the classic and definitive treatment for bleeding gastric varices secondary to splenic vein thrombosis.\n\nThe answer is (D)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p03", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p03-003", "question": "A 55-year-old man with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis presents with acute worsening dyspnea.

Importantly, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) ruled out infection and showed neutrophilia, which is a typical finding in AE-IPF.\n\nThe management of AE-IPF is challenging and has a high mortality rate.

High-dose systemic corticosteroids (Option A) are the most widely accepted pharmacologic treatment for AE-IPF, despite the evidence quality being low. A common regimen involves pulse doses of methylprednisolone (e.g., 500–1000 mg/day for 3 days) followed by an oral taper. This is intended to reduce the acute inflammation indicated by the ground-glass opacities and BAL neutrophilia.\n2.  Azathioprine (Option B) is contraindicated.

Pirfenidone (Option C) and Nintedanib (Option D) are antifibrotic agents used for the chronic maintenance treatment of IPF to slow disease progression. While they reduce the risk of developing exacerbations, there is no evidence to support dose escalation or acute initiation as a \"rescue\" treatment to resolve the acute respiratory failure associated with an established exacerbation.\n4.  Lung transplantation evaluation (Option E) is appropriate for long-term management and survival, especially given the poor prognosis of AE-IPF.

The management of infected cysts typically follows a step-wise approach:\n1.  Antibiotics: First-line therapy involves lipophilic antibiotics (specifically fluoroquinolones like ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) which can penetrate the cyst wall. The prompt states the patient has received \"appropriate intravenous antibiotics\" yet symptoms persist, indicating treatment failure.\n2.  Drainage: When an infected cyst is refractory to antibiotic therapy (usually defined as persistent fever/symptoms after 1-2 weeks, or earlier if unstable), drainage is indicated.\n3.  Modality of Drainage:\n    *   Percutaneous Drainage: This is generally the preferred next step for large (>3-5 cm) infected cysts. However, success depends on the cyst structure.\n    *   Surgical Drainage (Decortication/Unroofing): This is indicated when percutaneous drainage fails, is not feasible, or if the cyst is complex (multiloculated/septated).\n\nIn this scenario, there are two key factors pointing towards surgical management (Option D) over percutaneous drainage with sclerotherapy (Option B):\n1.  Internal Septations: The imaging reveals a \"6 cm cyst with internal septations\". Percutaneous drainage of a septated (multiloculated) cyst is frequently unsuccessful because a single catheter cannot drain all the separate compartments (locules). Surgical decortication (unroofing) allows for the mechanical breakdown of septations and complete drainage.\n2.  Sclerotherapy: Option B includes sclerotherapy. Sclerotherapy (instillation of agents like ethanol) is typically utilized for symptomatic *sterile* simple cysts to prevent fluid re-accumulation. It is generally contraindicated in the presence of acute infection and inflammation, as it can be dangerous and is not the primary treatment for an abscess.\n\nOption A is incorrect because \"appropriate\" antibiotics imply the correct drug class (lipophilic) and sensitivity were already considered; in the setting of a large purulent collection (abscess) that is not responding, source control (drainage) is required rather than just medication changes. Option C is for recurrent infection prevention. Option E is not a standard therapy.\n\nTherefore, given the complex nature of the cyst (septations) and the failure of medical therapy, along with the contraindication of sclerotherapy in acute infection, surgical decortication is the most appropriate next step.\n\nThe answer is (D)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p03", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p03-005", "question": "A 62-year-old woman with chronic lymphocytic leukemia develops petechiae and easy bruising.

In CLL, the major causes of thrombocytopenia are:\n1.  Bone marrow infiltration (myelophthisis): Replacement of normal hematopoietic tissue by leukemic cells.\n2.  Autoimmune thrombocytopenia (ITP): Peripheral destruction of platelets mediated by autoantibodies.\n3.  Splenic sequestration (hypersplenism): Triggered by splenomegaly.\n\nTo determine the most likely mechanism, one must evaluate the bone marrow findings.\n*   Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP): This is a well-known complication of CLL. However, in ITP, the bone marrow typically shows normal to increased numbers of megakaryocytes (reflecting the marrow's attempt to compensate for peripheral destruction). Additionally, while the marrow might show some leukemic involvement, the degree of thrombocytopenia is often disproportionate to the burden of disease.\n*   Bone Marrow Infiltration: The biopsy in this case shows 90% infiltration by small lymphocytes. This represents a \"packed marrow\" where the leukemic cells have physically replaced the normal hematopoietic elements, including megakaryocytes (platelet precursors) and erythroid precursors (red blood cell precursors).\n\nThe severity of the infiltration (90%) correlates strongly with the cytopenias (anemia and thrombocytopenia) due to the lack of physical space and resources for normal blood cell production. Diagnosing ITP in CLL is generally a diagnosis of exclusion, typically considered when the marrow is not heavily infiltrated or when megakaryocytes are preserved. Given the massive infiltration described, the direct suppression of hematopoiesis is the primary and most likely mechanism.\n\nHypersplenism usually causes mild to moderate cytopenias, not the severe thrombocytopenia seen here (12,000/μL).

Diagnosis: The patient is diagnosed with Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID). The clinical picture confirms this: a 28-year-old adult with recurrent sinopulmonary infections, markedly reduced serum immunoglobulin levels (IgG 150 mg/dL is very low, IgA is absent, IgM is low), and impaired antibody response to vaccines.\n\n2.  Pathophysiology: CVID is characterized by defective B-cell differentiation and impaired antibody production. *TACI* (*TNFRSF13B*) mutations are a known genetic cause or risk factor associated with CVID, often linked to defects in B-cell regulation and class-switch recombination.\n\n3.  Management Principles: The primary goal in managing CVID is to prevent infections and the development of chronic lung disease (like bronchiectasis) caused by the lack of protective antibodies.\n\n4.  Evaluating the Options:\n    *   A. Monthly intravenous immunoglobulin replacement: Immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IgRT), administered either intravenously (IVIG) or subcutaneously (SCIG), is the standard of care for CVID. It replaces the missing antibodies (IgG), providing passive immunity against a broad range of pathogens. This helps prevent recurrent infections.\n    *   B. Prophylactic antibiotics: While prophylactic antibiotics are sometimes used as an adjunct in patients who continue to get infections despite IgRT or have structural lung damage, they are not the primary treatment for the underlying immunodeficiency (hypogammaglobulinemia).\n    *   C. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT): HSCT is curative but carries significant risks of morbidity and mortality. It is typically reserved for severe, refractory cases of CVID complicated by severe autoimmunity, lymphoproliferation, or malignancy, rather than typical cases presenting with infections.\n    *   D. Rituximab: Rituximab (anti-CD20) depletes B cells. It is used in CVID patients to treat autoimmune complications (like immune thrombocytopenia or hemolytic anemia) or lymphoproliferative disease. It is not used to treat the immunodeficiency itself, as it would suppress antibody production further (though production is already impaired).\n    *   E.

It is demonstrated to be superior to prednisone tapering alone in sustaining remission.\n    *   Methotrexate is an alternative but is generally considered less effective than tocilizumab and is recommended if tocilizumab is arguably not available or contraindicated.\n    *   Cyclophosphamide is typically reserved for life-threatening vasculitis or cases refractory to both steroids and tocilizumab. It is not the standard escalation for a first relapse, even with severe symptoms, unless there is a specific indication suggesting otherwise (e.g., severe organ failure not typical of GCA).\n\n3.  Acute Management of Vision Loss: While the immediate management of GCA-related vision loss usually involves IV pulse methylprednisolone to save remaining vision, this option is not listed. Increasing oral prednisone to 60 mg (Option A) treats the acute flare but does not address the need for therapy escalation to prevent further relapses and allow for successful steroid tapering, which is the core issue in a patient relapsing on steroids. Furthermore, current guidelines conditionally recommend the combination of glucocorticoids and tocilizumab for patients with extracranial large-vessel involvement.\n\nTherefore, initiating tocilizumab is the most appropriate *escalation* in the therapeutic regimen for a patient with relapsing GCA and large-vessel involvement.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p03", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p03-008", "question": "A 25-year-old man with HIV on antiretroviral therapy presents with headache and seizures.

Histologic Transformation: Transformation from NSCLC (adenocarcinoma) to SCLC occurs in approximately 3-14% of EGFR-mutant patients as a mechanism of resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).\n2.  Treatment of Transformed SCLC: Once the tumor transforms to SCLC, it typically behaves aggressively, similar to de novo SCLC. Clinical guidelines (such as NCCN) and retrospective data support treating these patients with standard SCLC chemotherapy regimens.\n3.  Standard Regimen: The standard first-line chemotherapy for SCLC is a platinum agent (cisplatin or carboplatin) combined with etoposide.\n4.  Evaluation of Options:\n    *   A. Continue osimertinib with added chemotherapy: While continuing TKI might be considered in some \"oligoprogressive\" scenarios or to suppress the adenocarcinoma clone, the dominant clinical issue is the SCLC transformation. The standard of care is to switch to an SCLC-appropriate regimen. Often, the TKI is discontinued.\n    *   B.

These tumors tend to be sensitive to cytotoxic chemotherapy typical for SCLC.\n    *   D. Use mobocertinib as targeted therapy: Similar to amivantamab, mobocertinib targets EGFR exon 20 insertions in NSCLC and does not address the neuroendocrine/small cell transformation.\n    *   E.

Treatment Goals: The goal of \"escalation\" in a patient with frequent attacks despite prophylaxis is to establish effective long-term prophylaxis (LTP) to reduce disease burden.\n4.  Evaluate Options:\n    *   A: Tranexamic acid is generally less effective than androgens and C1-inhibitor replacement.

This is the appropriate escalation for a patient failing oral therapy.\n    *   C & D: Icatibant and Ecallantide are on-demand therapies for *acute* attacks. While the patient needs an on-demand plan, simply adding acute medication does not address the failure of the prophylactic regimen to prevent the attacks effectively. Additionally, Icatibant (Firazyr) is FDA-approved for adults (18+), not a 12-year-old (though practices vary globally, exam guidelines usually adhere strictly to FDA labeling).\n    *   E: FFP is not used for routine prophylaxis or standard escalation; it represents a rescue option when specific therapies are unavailable.\n\nTherefore, switching/escalating to a more effective prophylactic regimen appropriate for his age is the correct answer.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}]
