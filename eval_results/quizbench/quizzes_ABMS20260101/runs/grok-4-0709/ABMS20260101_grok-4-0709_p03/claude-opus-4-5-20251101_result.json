This leads to isolated gastric varices (particularly fundal varices) because blood from the spleen cannot drain through the thrombosed splenic vein and instead flows retrograde through the short gastric veins into the gastric fundus.\n\nEvaluating options:\n\nA. Endoscopic band ligation - Less effective for gastric varices compared to esophageal varices; gastric varices are larger and have higher blood flow\n\nB. TIPS - Used for portal hypertension from liver disease, but in splenic vein thrombosis, the portal vein pressure is not elevated systemically; TIPS would not address the localized problem\n\nC. BRTO (Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration) - This is used for gastric varices with gastrorenal shunts, but it doesn't address the underlying cause in splenic vein thrombosis\n\nD. Splenectomy - This is the definitive treatment for sinistral portal hypertension caused by splenic vein thrombosis. Removing the spleen eliminates the source of increased venous pressure that causes the gastric varices.

Small cell transformation is a known resistance mechanism in EGFR-mutant NSCLC, occurring in approximately 3-14% of cases. When this transformation occurs, the tumor behaves biologically like small cell lung cancer.\n\n2. Treatment approach for SCLC transformation: The standard treatment follows small cell lung cancer guidelines, which means platinum-based chemotherapy with etoposide (EP regimen - etoposide + cisplatin or carboplatin). This is because the transformed tumor responds to SCLC-directed therapy.\n\n3. Why not other options:\n   - A (Continue osimertinib + chemo): While some advocate continuing EGFR TKI, the primary treatment should be SCLC-directed chemotherapy\n   - B (Amivantamab): This is approved for EGFR exon 20 insertions, but the tumor has transformed to SCLC, which won't respond to EGFR-targeted therapy\n   - D (Mobocertinib): Also targets EGFR exon 20 insertions, but again, SCLC transformation means the tumor biology has changed\n   - E (Immune checkpoint inhibitor): SCLC transformation in EGFR-mutant tumors typically doesn't respond well to immunotherapy, and platinum-etoposide is the standard first-line approach\n\n4. Standard of care: For SCLC transformation, the recommended approach is to treat as de novo SCLC with platinum-etoposide chemotherapy.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p03", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p03-010", "question": "A 12-year-old boy with hereditary angioedema type I presents with recurrent abdominal pain and facial swelling.

Tranexamic acid prophylaxis - This is actually a weaker prophylactic agent than danazol. Switching to this would be a step down, not escalation.\n\nB. Subcutaneous C1 inhibitor replacement - This is the most appropriate escalation. Plasma-derived C1 inhibitor (like Haegarda/Berinert SC) or lanadelumab are now first-line prophylactic therapies for HAE. They directly replace the deficient protein and are more effective than attenuated androgens like danazol.\n\nC. Icatibant for on-demand treatment - This is a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist used for acute attacks, not prophylaxis. While useful for breakthrough attacks, it doesn't address the need for better prophylaxis.\n\nD. Ecallantide for acute attacks - This is a kallikrein inhibitor for acute treatment, not prophylaxis. Also, ecallantide has age restrictions and risk of anaphylaxis.\n\nE. Fresh frozen plasma - This contains C1 inhibitor but also contains substrates that could theoretically worsen attacks. It's not a preferred option and is generally reserved when other options aren't available.\n\nThe question asks for escalation in therapy for a patient failing prophylaxis. The best escalation would be to switch to a more effective prophylactic regimen. Subcutaneous C1 inhibitor replacement (or lanadelumab) represents modern, guideline-recommended first-line prophylaxis that is more effective than danazol.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}]
