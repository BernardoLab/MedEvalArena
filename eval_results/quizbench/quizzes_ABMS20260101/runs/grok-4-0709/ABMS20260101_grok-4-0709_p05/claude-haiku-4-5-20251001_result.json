Key facts:\n- Pathology confirms Crohn's (transmural inflammation, non-caseating granulomas)\n- Postoperative symptoms: recurrent diarrhea and weight loss\n- Need to identify the MOST LIKELY complication\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\nA. Short bowel syndrome - This typically occurs after extensive small bowel resection (usually >50% loss). An ileocecal resection alone is usually not extensive enough to cause classic short bowel syndrome.\n\nB. Anastomotic stricture - This is a common complication of Crohn's disease surgery, but it typically presents with obstruction/constipation, not diarrhea and weight loss.\n\nC. Bacterial overgrowth - Possible, but less specific to ileocecal resection.\n\nD. Vitamin B12 deficiency - The terminal ileum is the specific site of B12 absorption. Ileocecal resection removes the terminal ileum, directly eliminating the site of intrinsic factor-mediated B12 absorption. This is a well-known consequence of ileocecal resection. However, B12 deficiency typically presents with neurologic symptoms or macrocytic anemia, not primarily with diarrhea and weight loss.\n\nE. Bile acid malabsorption - The terminal ileum is also the primary site of bile acid reabsorption. When the terminal ileum is resected, bile acids are not reabsorbed and pass into the colon, where they stimulate secretory diarrhea and fat malabsorption. This directly explains both the diarrhea and weight loss seen in this patient.\n\nBile acid malabsorption is the most direct and immediate consequence of ileocecal resection and best explains the clinical presentation of diarrhea and weight loss.\n\nThe answer is E"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p05", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p05-002", "question": "A 45-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate develops progressive dyspnea and dry cough.

Stenosis at this site is a known complication that can occur early or late post-procedure.\n\nWhy the findings matter:\n- Preserved ventricular function rules out primary myocardial failure\n- Elevated RAP + metabolic acidosis suggests inadequate systemic perfusion\n- The arch stenosis is the anatomic culprit causing increased afterload and poor systemic perfusion\n\nEvaluating options:\n\nA. Balloon angioplasty - This is the first-line intervention for neo-aortic arch stenosis post-Norwood. It's minimally invasive, can be done via catheterization, and is effective for relieving the obstruction.\n\nB. Surgical arch augmentation - Reserved for cases where angioplasty fails or restenosis occurs; not first-line.\n\nC. Fontan completion - This is a later stage procedure (typically at 3-4 years); premature given the patient is only 2 years old and has a correctable anatomic lesion.\n\nD. Heart transplantation - Not indicated when ventricular function is preserved and there's a correctable anatomic problem.\n\nE.
