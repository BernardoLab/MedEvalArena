The pathology confirms Crohn's disease (transmural inflammation and non-caseating granulomas). Postoperatively, she develops recurrent diarrhea and weight loss.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nA. Short bowel syndrome - This typically occurs after extensive small bowel resection (usually >100cm or >50% of small bowel). An ileocecal resection alone is usually limited and wouldn't cause short bowel syndrome.\n\nB. Anastomotic stricture - This can occur but typically presents with obstructive symptoms (cramping, bloating, nausea/vomiting) rather than primarily diarrhea.\n\nC. Bacterial overgrowth - Can occur with strictures or altered anatomy, but less common as a direct consequence of ileocecal resection.\n\nD. Vitamin B12 deficiency - The terminal ileum is where B12 is absorbed. Resection of the terminal ileum can lead to B12 deficiency, but this typically manifests over months to years (as B12 stores last 3-5 years) and presents with neurological symptoms and anemia rather than acute diarrhea.\n\nE. Bile acid malabsorption - The terminal ileum is the site of bile acid reabsorption. When the terminal ileum is resected, bile acids are not reabsorbed and pass into the colon where they cause secretory diarrhea. This is a very common and immediate complication following ileocecal resection, presenting with watery diarrhea and can lead to weight loss.\n\nGiven that the patient has diarrhea and weight loss following ileocecal resection, the most likely immediate complication is bile acid malabsorption. This occurs because the terminal ileum (which was resected) is responsible for reabsorbing bile acids. Without this reabsorption, bile acids reach the colon and cause secretory diarrhea.\n\nThe answer is (E)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p05", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p05-002", "question": "A 45-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate develops progressive dyspnea and dry cough.

RA-associated UIP: The HRCT findings of subpleural reticular opacities and traction bronchiectasis are classic for UIP pattern.

Dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) gene mutation: This is a well-documented mechanism of TMP-SMX resistance in Pneumocystis jirovecii. DHPS is the target of sulfamethoxazole, and mutations in this gene can lead to resistance and breakthrough infections despite prophylaxis.\n\nB. Non-adherence to prophylaxis: While possible, this is a behavioral factor and the question seems to be asking for a biological/pharmacological explanation.\n\nC. Concurrent CMV co-infection: CMV can cause immunosuppression and ground-glass opacities, but it wouldn't directly explain TMP-SMX prophylaxis failure for PCP.\n\nD. Inadequate dosing in obesity: There's no mention of obesity in the stem, making this less likely.\n\nE. Atovaquone cross-resistance: Atovaquone works through a completely different mechanism (inhibiting cytochrome bc1 complex in mitochondria) compared to TMP-SMX (folate synthesis pathway). There is no cross-resistance between these drugs.\n\nThe most likely explanation for breakthrough PCP infection in a patient on TMP-SMX prophylaxis is DHPS gene mutation. This is a recognized mechanism of sulfonamide resistance in P. jirovecii. Studies have shown that DHPS mutations are associated with prophylaxis failure, particularly in patients on long-term sulfonamide prophylaxis.\n\nThe negative beta-D-glucan is interesting but can occur in PCP (sensitivity is not 100%), and the BAL PCR confirms the diagnosis.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p05", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p05-004", "question": "A 9-year-old girl with neurofibromatosis type 1 presents with hypertension and headaches.

The standard approach is:\n- First: Alpha-blockade (phenoxybenzamine is the classic choice)\n- Then: Beta-blockade (only AFTER adequate alpha-blockade to prevent unopposed alpha stimulation)\n\nWhy not other options?\n\nB. ACE inhibitors - While these might help with renovascular hypertension, they are contraindicated in bilateral renal artery stenosis (can cause acute kidney injury). Also, they don't address the catecholamine excess from pheochromocytoma.\n\nC. Percutaneous renal artery angioplasty - This is an intervention, not initial medical management. Also, performing any procedure without first controlling the pheochromocytoma would be dangerous.\n\nD. Calcium channel blockers - While these can be used as adjunctive therapy in pheochromocytoma, they are not the first-line treatment. Alpha-blockade remains the cornerstone of preoperative preparation.\n\nE. Surgical resection without preoperative preparation - This is dangerous and contraindicated. Uncontrolled catecholamine release during surgery can cause severe hypertensive crisis, arrhythmias, and death.\n\nThe priority here is the pheochromocytoma because:\n1.

The patient has significant neurological deficits (paraparesis, urinary retention) that are not responding to first-line treatment.\n\nAnalysis of Options:\n\nA. Plasma exchange (PLEX) - This is the established second-line treatment for severe MS relapses that fail to respond to high-dose corticosteroids. Multiple studies support its use in steroid-refractory attacks, particularly for severe relapses affecting motor function.\n\nB. Rituximab - This is a disease-modifying therapy (DMT), not an acute relapse treatment. It would take weeks to months to show benefit.\n\nC. Fingolimod - This is a DMT for long-term MS management, not for acute relapse treatment.\n\nD. Repeat lumbar puncture - CSF analysis has already been done and shows typical MS findings. Repeating it would not change acute management and would delay treatment.\n\nE. Natalizumab - This is a highly effective DMT but is used for disease modification, not acute relapse management. It wouldn't address the immediate crisis.\n\nConclusion:\nFor a steroid-refractory severe MS relapse with significant myelopathy, plasma exchange is the recommended next step.

The key information is that the infant is already on:\n- Maximal ventilatory support\n- Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO)\n\nDespite these interventions, oxygenation remains poor.\n\nLet me analyze each option:\n\nA. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) - This is the rescue therapy for refractory PPHN when conventional treatments fail. CDH with PPHN is one of the classic indications for ECMO when maximal medical management fails.\n\nB. Intravenous milrinone - While milrinone is a pulmonary vasodilator and inotrope that can be used in PPHN, it would typically be tried before or alongside iNO, not as a rescue after iNO failure in this severe scenario.\n\nC. High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) - The question states \"maximal ventilatory support\" which would typically include HFOV as part of the ventilation strategy. This has likely already been tried.\n\nD. Surgical revision of hernia repair - There's no indication of surgical complications mentioned. The problem is pulmonary hypertension, not a mechanical issue with the repair.\n\nE. Prostaglandin E1 infusion - PGE1 is used to keep the ductus arteriosus open in ductal-dependent cardiac lesions. In PPHN, we actually want the ductus to close (or at least not worsen right-to-left shunting). PGE1 would be contraindicated here.\n\nThe standard algorithm for CDH with refractory PPHN is: gentle ventilation → iNO → ECMO if failing. Since this neonate has failed maximal conventional therapy including iNO, ECMO is the appropriate next step and is a well-established rescue therapy for this exact clinical scenario.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p05", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p05-010", "question": "A 2-year-old boy with hypoplastic left heart syndrome post-Norwood procedure presents with feeding intolerance and metabolic acidosis.

The arch reconstruction involves using the native pulmonary artery and homograft tissue, which can develop stenosis over time.\n\nThe stenosis is causing:\n- Increased afterload on the single right ventricle\n- Elevated filling pressures (elevated RA pressure)\n- Poor systemic perfusion leading to metabolic acidosis\n- Feeding intolerance due to poor cardiac output\n\nEvaluating Options:\n\nA. Balloon angioplasty of the arch stenosis - This is the first-line intervention for neo-aortic arch stenosis. It's less invasive than surgery and can effectively relieve the obstruction. Catheter-based intervention is preferred when feasible.\n\nB. Surgical arch augmentation - This would be considered if balloon angioplasty fails or if the stenosis is not amenable to catheter intervention.\n\nC. Fontan completion - This is Stage 3 palliation, typically done around age 2-4, but the patient needs the arch obstruction addressed first. Proceeding to Fontan with significant arch stenosis would be contraindicated.\n\nD. Heart transplantation - Not indicated as ventricular function is preserved. The problem is mechanical obstruction, not heart failure.\n\nE. Medical management with afterload reduction - This doesn't address the underlying mechanical problem and would be insufficient.\n\nBest Answer:\nGiven that catheterization has already identified the stenosis, and balloon angioplasty is the standard first-line intervention for neo-aortic arch stenosis post-Norwood (less invasive, can be done during the same catheterization), this is the most appropriate initial intervention.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}]
