The patient has pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs), which are common in HHT.\n\nLet me analyze each option:\n\nA. Prophylactic coil embolization of all visible AVMs - This is actually close to the recommended approach. Current guidelines recommend treating PAVMs with feeding arteries ≥3mm to prevent complications like stroke, brain abscess, and hemorrhage. However, \"all visible\" may be too aggressive as very small AVMs may not require treatment.\n\nB. Lifelong anticoagulation with warfarin - This is contraindicated in HHT patients as it would worsen bleeding complications from telangiectasias and AVMs.\n\nC. Serial transcatheter embolotherapy guided by symptom recurrence - This is a reactive approach. However, PAVMs can cause serious complications (paradoxical emboli leading to stroke/brain abscess) even before symptoms occur. Waiting for symptoms is not optimal.\n\nD. Surgical lobectomy for affected lung segments - This is overly aggressive and not first-line. Embolotherapy is preferred as it's less invasive and preserves lung tissue.\n\nE. Observation with annual CT angiography - This alone is insufficient for PAVMs that meet treatment criteria, as it doesn't prevent complications.\n\nThe current standard of care for PAVMs in HHT involves:\n1. Screening with contrast echocardiography\n2. CT angiography to characterize PAVMs\n3. Embolization of PAVMs with feeding arteries ≥2-3mm\n4. Follow-up imaging to detect reperfusion or new PAVMs\n\nOption A, while slightly aggressive in wording (\"all visible\"), represents the proactive embolization approach that is the cornerstone of PAVM management. The goal is to prevent complications by treating significant PAVMs before they cause problems, rather than waiting for symptoms (option C) or just observing (option E).\n\nThe answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p01-002", "question": "A 28-year-old man in the emergency department after a motor vehicle collision has hypotension, tachycardia, and abdominal distension.

Arthroscopic-assisted reduction and internal fixation - While useful for some tibial plateau fractures, arthroscopic assistance alone may not adequately address a significantly depressed fragment that requires elevation and bone grafting.\n\nC.

It allows:\n- Direct visualization of the articular surface\n- Elevation of the depressed fragment\n- Bone grafting to support the elevated fragment and prevent subsidence\n- Buttress plating to maintain reduction\n- Ability to address meniscal pathology\n\nD.
