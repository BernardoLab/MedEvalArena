This is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by vascular dysplasia leading to telangiectasias and AVMs in multiple organs.\n\nKey Considerations for Management:\n\n1. Prophylactic coil embolization (A): While embolization is used, prophylactic treatment of ALL visible AVMs is not standard practice. Many small AVMs remain asymptomatic and don't require intervention.\n\n2. Lifelong anticoagulation (B): Anticoagulation is contraindicated in HHT as it increases bleeding risk from telangiectasias and AVMs.\n\n3. Serial transcatheter embolotherapy (C): This is the standard approach - treating AVMs that are symptomatic or at high risk of complications (large size, high flow, location). This allows for selective intervention based on clinical need.\n\n4. Surgical lobectomy (D): Surgery is rarely indicated and reserved for massive hemoptysis or other extreme circumstances. It's not a long-term management strategy.\n\n5. Observation with annual CT (E): While monitoring is important, this is insufficient for symptomatic patients with hemoptysis.\n\nBest Answer:\nThe patient is already symptomatic (hemoptysis, dyspnea), so observation alone is inadequate. The standard long-term management of pulmonary AVMs in HHT is selective transcatheter embolotherapy guided by symptom recurrence and AVM characteristics (size, flow rate, location).

Hemodynamic stability - This is the primary concern in a septic shock patient on vasopressors\n   - Continuous therapies are superior to intermittent therapies for hemodynamic stability\n   - Gradual fluid removal prevents sudden shifts\n\n2. Metabolic acidosis management\n   - Need effective acid removal\n   - Citrate anticoagulation provides metabolic benefits (citrate is metabolized to bicarbonate)\n\n3. Anticoagulation choice\n   - Citrate anticoagulation is preferred in sepsis/critical illness\n   - Reduces bleeding risk compared to heparin\n   - Provides additional metabolic benefit\n\nEvaluating options:\n\nA. Continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) with citrate anticoagulation\n- Continuous modality ✓ (best for hemodynamics)\n- Combines diffusion and convection ✓ (excellent solute removal)\n- Citrate anticoagulation ✓ (safer, metabolic benefit)\n- Addresses metabolic acidosis effectively ✓\n\nB. Intermittent hemodialysis\n- Intermittent modality ✗ (poor hemodynamic stability in septic shock)\n- Rapid fluid shifts can worsen hypotension\n\nC. Sustained low-efficiency dialysis\n- Better than intermittent but not optimal for hemodynamic stability\n\nD.

This means more unbound (active) drug is available, causing toxicity despite \"normal\" total levels.\n\nWhat causes elevated free fraction of carbamazepine?\n\nThe most common cause is displacement from protein binding due to drug interactions. Other drugs can compete for protein binding sites, displacing carbamazepine and increasing its free (active) concentration.\n\nWhy other options don't fit:\n\n- A (Hyponatremia): Carbamazepine can cause hyponatremia, but this wouldn't explain elevated free fraction\n- C (Autoinduction): Carbamazepine causes autoinduction, but this would decrease levels, not increase free fraction with normal total levels\n- D (Hepatic failure): Would affect metabolism but wouldn't specifically elevate free fraction with normal total levels\n- E (Renal impairment): Carbamazepine is metabolized hepatically, not renally\n\nCorrect answer:\n\nWith elevated free fraction and therapeutic total levels, the issue is protein binding displacement from a drug interaction. The solution is to reduce the dose since the patient is getting adequate (actually excessive) active drug despite normal total levels.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}]
