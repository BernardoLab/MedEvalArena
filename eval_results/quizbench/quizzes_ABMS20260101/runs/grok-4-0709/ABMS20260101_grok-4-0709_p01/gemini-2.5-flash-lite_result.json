The presence of dyspnea and hemoptysis indicates symptomatic PAVMs that require management to prevent recurrent complications like pulmonary hypertension, paradoxical embolism, stroke, or worsening hemoptysis.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. Prophylactic coil embolization of all visible AVMs: While embolization is the treatment of choice for PAVMs, embolizing *all* visible PAVMs prophylactically is often not indicated or feasible. Indications for embolization are typically based on the size of the involved vessels (e.g., feeding artery >3mm, draining vein >5mm), presence of a significant shunt, or symptoms. Not all PAVMs require intervention.\nB. Lifelong anticoagulation with warfarin: Anticoagulation is generally contraindicated in HHT patients with PAVMs. It carries a significant risk of bleeding complications (hemorrhage) without preventing shunt-related risks like stroke or paradoxical embolism.\nC. Serial transcatheter embolotherapy guided by symptom recurrence: This is the cornerstone of managing PAVMs in HHT. Transcatheter embolization is used to close PAVMs that are symptomatic or deemed high-risk for complications. Since HHT is a progressive condition, new PAVMs can develop or existing ones can enlarge, necessitating serial interventions guided by symptoms, physical findings, or imaging. This approach aims to preserve lung function while mitigating risks.\nD. Surgical lobectomy for affected lung segments: Surgical resection of lung segments is reserved for PAVMs that are extensive, multiple, or not amenable to transcatheter embolization. It is a more invasive approach and not the preferred first-line long-term strategy for most PAVMs.\nE. Observation with annual CT angiography: For a patient with progressive dyspnea and hemoptysis, passive observation with annual imaging alone is insufficient. These symptoms indicate active complications or significant disease burden that likely requires intervention rather than just continued surveillance.\n\nGiven the patient's symptomatic PAVMs (dyspnea, hemoptysis) and diagnosis of HHT, serial transcatheter embolotherapy guided by clinical status and risk assessment is the most appropriate long-term management strategy to prevent recurrent pulmonary complications.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p01-002", "question": "A 28-year-old man in the emergency department after a motor vehicle collision has hypotension, tachycardia, and abdominal distension.

Severe preeclampsia with HELLP syndrome: Thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and hemolysis are the defining criteria for HELLP syndrome, a severe variant of preeclampsia.\n2.  Gestational age: 28 weeks gestation, which is preterm.\n3.  Fetal distress: Non-reassuring fetal heart rate patterns indicate compromised fetal well-being.\n4.  History of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS): While relevant, the immediate concern is the current obstetric emergency.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\nA.  Expectant management with close monitoring: This is contraindicated in a situation of severe preeclampsia/HELLP syndrome with fetal distress, especially at this gestational age. Continuing the pregnancy poses significant risks to both mother and fetus.\n\nB.  Immediate delivery via cesarean section: HELLP syndrome, particularly when severe, and non-reassuring fetal status are indications for urgent delivery. Given the fetal distress, delivery is the management of choice regardless of gestational age, though delaying delivery for maturation of fetal organs is usually considered in less critical situations. Here, the fetal distress overrides the potential benefits of further gestation.\n\nC.  Administration of intravenous magnesium sulfate alone: Magnesium sulfate is crucial for preventing or treating eclamptic seizures in severe preeclampsia. However, it is a supportive measure and does not address the underlying cause of maternal and fetal compromise, nor does it resolve the HELLP syndrome or fetal distress. Delivery is needed to resolve the HELLP syndrome.\n\nD.  Plasma exchange therapy: While the patient has a history of APS, plasma exchange is not the primary immediate management for HELLP syndrome or fetal distress. Delivery is the definitive treatment for HELLP syndrome. Plasma exchange might be considered for very severe APS manifestations, but delivery takes precedence in this acute scenario.\n\nE.  High-dose corticosteroid initiation: Antenatal corticosteroids are administered to promote fetal lung maturity when preterm delivery is anticipated. While beneficial for the fetus if delivery is imminent, they are not the primary management for the maternal crisis of severe preeclampsia/HELLP syndrome or the immediate fetal distress. They are given to *prepare* for delivery, not to *manage* the acute crisis itself.\n\nConsidering the combination of severe preeclampsia/HELLP syndrome and fetal distress at 28 weeks, immediate delivery is the most appropriate and life-saving intervention for both mother and fetus.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p01-004", "question": "A 55-year-old man undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting develops refractory hypotension post-cardiopulmonary bypass.

This clinical picture is highly suggestive of RV failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension, leading to reduced cardiac output and systemic hypotension.\n\nWe need a pharmacologic intervention that addresses both the elevated PAP (RV afterload) and potentially improves RV contractility.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\nA. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO): iNO is a selective pulmonary vasodilator. It reduces PAP by dilating pulmonary arteries, thereby decreasing RV afterload. This can improve RV function and stroke volume.\n\nB. Intravenous dobutamine: Dobutamine is a beta-agonist with positive inotropic and chronotropic effects. It can improve RV contractility. However, it can also increase myocardial oxygen demand and, in some cases, may increase pulmonary vascular resistance or RV afterload, potentially worsening RV failure.\n\nC. Milrinone infusion: Milrinone is a phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor. It exerts positive inotropic effects on the myocardium (including the RV) and also causes vasodilation, reducing both systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). By reducing PVR, it decreases RV afterload, and by improving RV contractility, it enhances RV function. This dual action makes it particularly beneficial in RV failure with pulmonary hypertension.\n\nD. Norepinephrine bolus: Norepinephrine is a potent alpha-1 adrenergic agonist, increasing SVR and blood pressure. While it raises systemic blood pressure, it can increase RV afterload due to alpha-mediated vasoconstriction, potentially exacerbating RV failure. It does not directly address the pulmonary hypertension or RV contractility issues.\n\nE. Vasopressin drip: Vasopressin is a potent vasoconstrictor that raises SVR and blood pressure. It has no direct inotropic effect and does not reduce PAP. It is not the primary treatment for RV failure due to pulmonary hypertension.\n\nConsidering the scenario, both iNO and milrinone are aimed at reducing RV afterload. However, the RV dilation and septal shift indicate that the RV itself may be compromised, not just overwhelmed by pressure. Milrinone offers the advantage of improving RV contractility in addition to reducing pulmonary vascular resistance. In post-cardiac surgery patients, myocardial stunning or dysfunction is common, making agents that support contractility crucial. Milrinone is a well-established therapy for RV failure in the context of pulmonary hypertension, especially post-cardiac surgery, as it addresses both impaired contractility and high afterload.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p01-005", "question": "A 45-year-old man with treatment-resistant depression and a history of electroconvulsive therapy presents with catatonia, mutism, and waxy flexibility.

Bilateral electroconvulsive therapy (ECT): ECT is a highly effective and well-established treatment for catatonia, particularly when it is severe, life-threatening, or unresponsive to benzodiazepines. Given that the patient has not responded to lorazepam, ECT is indicated as the next most appropriate step. Bilateral ECT is generally considered more effective for catatonia than unilateral ECT.\n\nB. Intravenous amobarbital challenge: This diagnostic procedure can be used to differentiate between organic catatonia and other conditions, or to assess the depth of stupor. However, it is not a treatment for catatonia.\n\nC. High-dose olanzapine initiation: Antipsychotics are generally not the first-line treatment for catatonia and can sometimes worsen certain catatonic features or potentially lead to neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Benzodiazepines are preferred pharmacologically, and ECT is the definitive somatic treatment when pharmacotherapy fails.\n\nD. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS): rTMS is primarily used for the treatment of resistant depression. While the patient has a history of depression, the current acute concern is severe catatonia, for which rTMS is not the standard or most effective treatment.\n\nE.

Some studies suggest efficacy, but ECT remains the gold standard and most robustly studied treatment for severe, refractory catatonia. Given the severity and lack of response to lorazepam, ECT is generally considered the most appropriate next step.\n\nIn summary, after failure of lorazepam for severe catatonia, ECT is the next most appropriate step in management due to its proven efficacy and established role as a definitive treatment for this condition.\n\nThe answer is A"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p01-006", "question": "A 65-year-old man undergoes laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis.

PUK is a sight-threatening condition that indicates severe, aggressive systemic inflammation, often associated with rheumatoid vasculitis.\n\nThe immediate priority in managing PUK is to suppress the intense inflammation rapidly to prevent corneal perforation and vision loss. High-dose systemic corticosteroids are the cornerstone of acute management for such conditions due to their potent, broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory effects and rapid onset of action.\n\nIn addition to controlling the acute event, the underlying systemic disease activity needs to be managed more effectively, as the current MTX therapy is insufficient. Chronic immunosuppression is required to prevent recurrence and preserve organ function.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA.  Add infliximab infusion: Infliximab is a TNF-alpha inhibitor biologic DMARD, highly effective for RA and associated vasculitis. It is a good option for adding further immunosuppression, but its onset of action might be slower than corticosteroids for an acute emergency like corneal melt.\nB.  Switch to rituximab: Rituximab is a B-cell depleting biologic. It is also used for RA, particularly with vasculitis, but similar to infliximab, it may not provide the immediate rapid control needed for a sight-threatening emergency.\nC.  Initiate cyclophosphamide: Cyclophosphamide is a potent cytotoxic agent used for severe, life-threatening autoimmune diseases, especially systemic vasculitis. While effective, it carries significant toxicity and is often reserved for more severe or refractory cases unless clear signs of systemic vasculitis warrant its immediate use.\nD.  Topical cyclosporine: Topical cyclosporine is used for localized ocular inflammation, primarily in dry eye disease or uveitis. It is not sufficient to address the underlying systemic inflammatory process causing PUK.\nE.  Systemic corticosteroids with azathioprine: This option combines two key elements. Systemic corticosteroids (e.g., high-dose prednisone) provide the rapid, potent anti-inflammatory effect necessary to manage the acute sight-threatening PUK. Azathioprine is an immunosuppressive agent that works as a steroid-sparing medication, providing longer-term control of the underlying autoimmune disease and helping to taper off corticosteroids. This is a well-established, comprehensive approach for severe inflammatory flares of autoimmune diseases like RA with significant extra-articular manifestations.\n\nGiven the sight-threatening nature of corneal melt and PUK, rapid and potent immunosuppression is critical. Systemic corticosteroids are essential for immediate control. Azathioprine is a suitable agent for long-term immunosuppression, enabling steroid-sparing. This combination addresses both the acute emergency and the chronic disease management effectively. While biologics or cyclophosphamide might be considered for the underlying systemic disease, starting systemic corticosteroids is crucial for the ocular emergency itself, and azathioprine is a standard companion for such severe flares.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{E}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p01-008", "question": "A 25-year-old athlete sustains a tibial plateau fracture with associated meniscal tear and ACL disruption.

The primary surgical goal for a depressed tibial plateau fracture is to achieve anatomical reduction of the articular surface to restore joint congruity and prevent post-traumatic arthritis.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. External fixation: While useful for severely comminuted or unstable fractures and soft tissue compromise, it typically does not provide the precise intra-articular reduction needed for a depressed fragment. It is often a temporary or adjunctive measure.\nB. Arthroscopic-assisted reduction and internal fixation: Arthroscopy is excellent for diagnosing and treating intra-articular injuries (meniscus, cartilage). It can be used for reduction and fixation of some tibial plateau fractures, especially those that are less complex or non-depressed. However, for significantly depressed fragments, direct visualization and manipulation afforded by open surgery are often superior for achieving anatomical reduction and placing support like bone graft and fixation.\nC. Open reduction with bone grafting and buttress plating: This approach offers direct visualization of the articular surface, allowing for accurate reduction of depressed fragments. Bone grafting is crucial to support the reduced fragment and prevent collapse, especially if there is comminution or impaction. Buttress plating provides stable fixation that supports the articular reduction, preventing displacement. This is the gold standard for unstable, depressed tibial plateau fractures requiring anatomical restoration. The meniscal tear and ACL disruption can be addressed concomitantly or sequentially.\nD. Total knee arthroplasty: This is a joint replacement procedure, typically reserved for end-stage arthritis or severe, irreparable joint damage. It is inappropriate for a 25-year-old athlete with a fracture for whom joint reconstruction is the goal.\nE. Nonoperative management: A depressed tibial plateau fracture requires reduction. Nonoperative management would lead to malunion, malalignment, chronic pain, and early degenerative joint disease, which is unacceptable in a young athlete.\n\nConsidering the depressed fragment and the need to restore joint congruity in a young athlete, open reduction with bone grafting and buttress plating is the most definitive and optimal approach to achieve anatomical restoration and provide stable fixation.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p01-009", "question": "In the ICU, a 55-year-old patient with septic shock on vasopressors develops acute kidney injury and metabolic acidosis.

Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is initiated, which is the preferred modality for managing acute kidney injury (AKI) in hemodynamically unstable patients because it allows for gradual and controlled removal of fluid and solutes, minimizing hemodynamic fluctuations. Intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) and sustained low-efficiency dialysis (SLED) are generally associated with greater hemodynamic instability due to rapid shifts. Peritoneal dialysis is not typically used in the acute care setting for critically ill patients. Therefore, options B, C, and D are less appropriate.\n\nThis leaves us with options A (Continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration with citrate anticoagulation) and E (Continuous venovenous hemofiltration alone), both of which are CRRT modalities.\n\nContinuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) combines filtration (convection) and diffusion, providing efficient clearance of both small and middle molecules. This comprehensive solute removal can be beneficial in septic shock for clearing inflammatory mediators and uremic toxins that contribute to hemodynamic instability. Citrate anticoagulation is a common and safe method for CRRT in critically ill patients, especially those at risk for bleeding or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, which can be present in sepsis.\n\nContinuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) relies solely on convection for solute and fluid removal. While it is also hemodynamically well-tolerated, CVVHDF is generally considered to offer more efficient solute clearance due to the addition of diffusive processes. Given the goal of optimizing hemodynamic stability in a patient with septic shock, a modality that offers comprehensive clearance of potential hemodynamic and inflammatory insults, such as CVVHDF, is generally considered most appropriate.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p01-010", "question": "A 40-year-old man with epilepsy on carbamazepine develops diplopia, ataxia, and nystagmus.

The key piece of information is that while the total serum carbamazepine levels are therapeutic, the free fraction is elevated.\n\nCarbamazepine is highly protein-bound (around 70-80%). The free fraction of a drug is the portion that is not bound to plasma proteins and is pharmacologically active. An elevated free fraction means that a larger proportion of the drug is unbound and available to exert effects on the central nervous system, leading to toxicity, even if the total serum concentration falls within the therapeutic range.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\nA. Hyponatremia; restrict fluids: Carbamazepine can cause hyponatremia, but hyponatremia is generally a separate side effect and not the direct cause of carbamazepine toxicity due to an elevated free fraction. Restricting fluids is a management strategy for hyponatremia.\n\nB. Drug interaction with protein binding; reduce dose: Various factors can reduce plasma protein binding of carbamazepine, leading to an increased free fraction. These include co-administration of other drugs that compete for protein binding sites, or conditions like hypoalbuminemia (seen in liver disease or malnutrition). If protein binding is reduced, a higher percentage of the total drug is free, causing toxicity. In this scenario, the most appropriate adjustment is to reduce the total dose of carbamazepine to lower the free (and total) concentration and alleviate toxicity. This option directly addresses the observed elevated free fraction and its consequence.\n\nC. Autoinduction; increase dose: Autoinduction is a phenomenon where carbamazepine induces its own metabolism, leading to decreased serum levels over time. This typically occurs after several weeks of therapy and would require dose adjustments if levels drop too low, not cause toxicity with therapeutic total levels. Increasing the dose would be incorrect when toxicity is suspected.\n\nD. Hepatic failure; switch to alternative: While hepatic failure can affect drug metabolism and protein synthesis (leading to lower albumin and thus increased free fraction), it is not explicitly stated that the patient has hepatic failure. Even if hepatic failure were the underlying cause of reduced protein binding, option B describes the mechanism (protein binding alteration) leading to the observed state and the direct management. if hepatic failure is the cause, reduced protein binding is the most likely mechanism for elevated free carbamezepine.\n\nE. Renal impairment; hemodialysis: Carbamazepine is primarily metabolized by the liver, with only a small percentage excreted renally as inactive metabolites. Renal impairment is therefore less likely to be the direct cause of carbamazepine toxicity, especially an elevated free fraction, unless it significantly impacts albumin levels. Hemodialysis is not a standard treatment for carbamazepine toxicity.\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely cause of carbamazepine toxicity with therapeutic total levels is an alteration in protein binding leading to an elevated free fraction. A drug interaction is a common cause of this. The appropriate adjustment is to reduce the dose.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."}]
