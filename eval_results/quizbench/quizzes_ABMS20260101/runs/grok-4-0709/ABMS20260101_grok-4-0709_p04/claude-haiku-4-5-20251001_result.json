Mild cognitive impairment\n3. Recurrent falls\n4. Orthostatic hypotension\n5. On donepezil (cholinesterase inhibitor for cognitive symptoms)\n6. Autonomic testing shows sympathetic denervation\n7. Brain MRI shows hippocampal atrophy\n\nAnalysis of Each Option:\n\nA. Alzheimer disease with autonomic involvement\n- Hippocampal atrophy is characteristic of AD\n- However, autonomic dysfunction (orthostatic hypotension, sympathetic denervation) is NOT a typical feature of pure AD\n- AD primarily causes cognitive decline and memory loss\n\nB. Lewy body dementia (LBD)\n- Presents with cognitive impairment, falls, and orthostatic hypotension\n- Autonomic dysfunction is a hallmark feature of LBD\n- Sympathetic denervation is characteristic\n- Often presents with parkinsonism, visual hallucinations, and REM sleep behavior disorder\n- Recurrent falls are common\n- Cholinesterase inhibitors (like donepezil) are used for cognitive symptoms in LBD\n- This fits the clinical picture well\n\nC. Multiple system atrophy\n- Causes autonomic dysfunction and falls\n- But typically shows striatal/olivopontocerebellar atrophy on MRI, not hippocampal atrophy\n- More prominent parkinsonism or cerebellar signs expected\n\nD. Vascular parkinsonism\n- Doesn't typically cause sympathetic denervation\n- Hippocampal atrophy would be less characteristic\n\nE. Progressive supranuclear palsy\n- Causes falls and cognitive decline\n- But autonomic dysfunction is not a primary feature\n- Characteristic vertical gaze palsy would be expected\n\nThe Best Answer:\nThe combination of cognitive impairment, orthostatic hypotension, sympathetic denervation, recurrent falls, and the use of cholinesterase inhibitors points to Lewy body dementia. The hippocampal atrophy can occur in LBD, and the autonomic dysfunction is a key distinguishing feature from pure Alzheimer disease.\n\nThe answer is B"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p04-002", "question": "A 6-month-old infant with known tetralogy of Fallot develops sudden cyanosis and agitation during a routine clinic visit.

Partial response to atropine - atropine blocks muscarinic receptors but doesn't address the underlying problem\n4.

Pregnancy and Mitral Stenosis: Pregnancy increases cardiac output and heart rate, which worsens mitral stenosis symptoms. The patient is presenting with acute decompensation (SOB, hemoptysis).\n\n2. Timing: At 20 weeks gestation, the fetus is viable but not yet at term. This is important for intervention planning.\n\n3. Hemodynamic Status: The patient is hemodynamically stable, which is crucial - this means she's not in cardiogenic shock or acute pulmonary edema requiring emergency intervention.\n\n4. Treatment Options Analysis:\n   - A. Percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty: This is the procedure of choice for symptomatic mitral stenosis in pregnancy. It can be performed safely during pregnancy with fetal shielding, has lower maternal morbidity than open surgery, and provides immediate relief of the stenosis.\n   - B. Open mitral commissurotomy: More invasive, requires cardiopulmonary bypass which is riskier in pregnancy\n   - C. Anticoagulation: May be needed but doesn't address the underlying stenosis\n   - D. Beta-blockers: Helpful for rate control but won't relieve the mechanical obstruction\n   - E. Termination: Not indicated when the mother is hemodynamically stable and other options exist\n\nBest Answer:\nPercutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty is the gold standard for symptomatic mitral stenosis in pregnancy.

The mechanism is typically conduction system injury from the prosthetic valve or balloon manipulation.\n\nRegarding each option:\n\nA. Permanent pacemaker implantation - This is the standard management for persistent complete heart block after TAVR. When CHB doesn't recover with temporary pacing, permanent pacemaker placement is indicated.\n\nB. Observation for 7 days with temporary pacing - While some guidelines suggest observing for 24-48 hours to see if rhythm recovers spontaneously, if CHB persists beyond this period (and the question states \"rhythm does not recover\"), waiting 7 days is not appropriate. Prolonged temporary pacing carries risks of infection and complications.\n\nC. Amiodarone infusion - This is for arrhythmia management, not for complete heart block. CHB requires electrical therapy/pacing, not antiarrhythmic drugs.\n\nD. Dual-chamber ICD - An ICD is for primary/secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death from ventricular arrhythmias. This patient needs pacing for bradycardia/asystole, not defibrillation. A pacemaker would be more appropriate than an ICD unless there's an additional indication.\n\nE.

CACNA1A mutations cause FHM type 1, the most common genetic form of hemiplegic migraine\n2. Calcium channel blockers are theoretically the most logical choice for calcium channelopathies\n3. Verapamil is a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that crosses the blood-brain barrier and has evidence supporting its use in FHM\n\nEvidence for treatment options:\n- Verapamil (A): Specifically recommended for FHM, particularly FHM1 with CACNA1A mutations. It blocks the same calcium channels affected by the mutation and has shown clinical benefit in case reports and small studies.\n- Topiramate (B): General migraine prophylaxis, not specifically targeted to calcium channelopathies\n- Propranolol (C): General migraine prophylaxis, not specific to FHM\n- Amitriptyline (D): General migraine prophylaxis, not specific to FHM\n- Valproate (E): General migraine prophylaxis, though some use in FHM, but not first-line\n\nThe pathophysiology directly involves calcium channel dysfunction, making verapamil (a calcium channel blocker) the most mechanistically appropriate and evidence-supported choice for FHM1/CACNA1A mutations.\n\nThe answer is A"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p04-009", "question": "A 65-year-old man with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy develops sudden syncope during exercise.

Syncope during exercise in HCM is a concerning symptom indicating hemodynamic compromise and increased risk of sudden cardiac death.\n\n2. LVOT gradient of 80 mmHg is significant obstruction (>50 mmHg is considered obstructive HCM).\n\n3. Failed medical therapy: The patient is already on beta-blockers (first-line) but symptoms persist.\n\n4. Management options for obstructive HCM with failed medical therapy:\n   - Surgical septal myectomy: Gold standard for symptomatic obstructive HCM refractory to medical therapy. Provides definitive relief of LVOT obstruction.\n   - Alcohol septal ablation: Alternative to surgery, less invasive, but typically reserved for patients who are poor surgical candidates or prefer less invasive approach.\n   - ICD placement: Indicated for sudden cardiac death prevention in high-risk patients, but doesn't address the hemodynamic obstruction.\n   - Dual-chamber pacing: Older approach, less effective than current options.\n   - Verapamil: Already tried (implied by beta-blocker use); additional negative inotrope but won't resolve obstruction.\n\n5.
