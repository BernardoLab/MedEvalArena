Brain MRI shows hippocampal atrophy.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA.  Alzheimer disease with autonomic involvement: While hippocampal atrophy is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), significant autonomic dysfunction, particularly sympathetic denervation leading to orthostatic hypotension, is not a primary or early feature of AD. Autonomic symptoms are typically mild and late if they occur.\n\nB.  Lewy body dementia (LBD): LBD is characterized by dementia, parkinsonism, and fluctuations in cognition. Crucially, autonomic dysfunction, including orthostatic hypotension due to sympathetic denervation, is a common and often early feature. Falls are also frequent. While hippocampal atrophy is more classic for AD, it can be seen in LBD as well, especially in the context of mixed pathology or as the disease progresses. The combination of MCI and pronounced autonomic failure strongly suggests LBD.\n\nC.  Multiple system atrophy (MSA): MSA is characterized by autonomic dysfunction (especially severe orthostatic hypotension), parkinsonism, and cerebellar signs. While autonomic failure is prominent, MSA typically presents with more severe motor symptoms (parkinsonism or ataxia) earlier on, and significant hippocampal atrophy is less common than in LBD or AD. The description doesn't emphasize parkinsonism or ataxia.\n\nD.  Vascular parkinsonism: This is caused by cerebrovascular disease affecting the basal ganglia. While it can cause gait disturbances, falls, and sometimes orthostatic hypotension, the underlying cause is vascular lesions (e.g., infarcts), and prominent sympathetic denervation is not as characteristic as it is for LBD or MSA. MRI findings would typically show vascular changes.\n\nE.  Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP): PSP is a parkinsonian syndrome characterized by early falls (often backward), vertical gaze palsy, and axial rigidity. Autonomic dysfunction is not a core feature of PSP.\n\nConsidering the constellation of symptoms, particularly the documented sympathetic denervation causing orthostatic hypotension alongside cognitive impairment, Lewy body dementia is the most likely diagnosis. The hippocampal atrophy doesn't exclude LBD, as mixed pathologies are common in dementias.\n\nThe answer is B"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p04-002", "question": "A 6-month-old infant with known tetralogy of Fallot develops sudden cyanosis and agitation during a routine clinic visit.

These spells are characterized by a sudden increase in cyanosis due to a reduction in pulmonary blood flow and/or an increase in right-to-left shunting of deoxygenated blood. Initial management involves measures to increase systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and decrease pulmonary artery pressure or right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (RVOTO). Knee-to-chest positioning and morphine are already being administered, which help by increasing SVR and reducing sympathetic tone/infundibular spasm, respectively.\n\nThe question asks for the *next best pharmacologic intervention* to abort the spell, given that echocardiography shows *severe right ventricular outflow tract obstruction*.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. Intravenous propranolol: Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker. It effectively reduces RVOTO by causing relaxation of the infundibular muscle, thereby decreasing the dynamic obstruction and increasing pulmonary blood flow. It also reduces heart rate and contractility, which can help decrease myocardial oxygen demand and prevent further worsening of the spell. Given the echocardiographic evidence of severe RVOTO, a medication that directly addresses this obstruction is highly desirable.\n\nB. Subcutaneous epinephrine: Epinephrine has mixed alpha- and beta-adrenergic effects. While alpha-agonism increases SVR (which can be beneficial), beta-agonism can increase heart rate and contractility, and potentially worsen infundibular spasm due to beta-2 receptor stimulation in the infundibular smooth muscle, thus potentially exacerbating the spell. It's generally not the first-line choice for aborting hypercyanotic spells.\n\nC. Intravenous phenylephrine: Phenylephrine is a pure alpha-1 adrenergic agonist, which causes systemic vasoconstriction and increases SVR. By increasing SVR, it makes right-to-left shunting across the VSD less favorable, thereby increasing relative pulmonary blood flow. It is an effective agent for aborting spells, especially when the primary issue is a decreased SVR or significant shunting.\n\nD. Oral sildenafil: Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor that causes pulmonary vasodilation. While improved pulmonary blood flow is beneficial, sildenafil is typically used for chronic management of pulmonary hypertension in infants and children with congenital heart disease, not for acute termination of hypercyanotic spells. Moreover, it can cause systemic vasodilation, potentially lowering SVR and worsening shunting.\n\nE. Intravenous esmolol: Esmolol is a cardioselective beta-1 adrenergic blocker. While it can reduce heart rate, it does not effectively block beta-2 receptors in the infundibulum, which are critical in managing infundibular spasm. Therefore, it is less effective than non-selective beta-blockers like propranolol for treating spells caused by RVOTO.\n\nComparing options A and C, both are used to abort hypercyanotic spells. However, the prompt specifically mentions \"severe right ventricular outflow tract obstruction\" on echocardiography. Propranolol directly targets this RVOTO by counteracting infundibular spasm and reducing the obstruction. Phenylephrine's benefit comes from increasing SVR to reduce the shunt across the VSD; it does not directly address the RVOTO itself. Therefore, given the confirmed severe RVOTO, propranolol is considered the most targeted and often preferred pharmacologic intervention to improve the underlying pathophysiology of the spell.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p04-003", "question": "A 35-year-old woman in the emergency department collapses after ingesting an unknown substance.

These symptoms are classical signs of cholinergic excess, which can occur from exposure to organophosphates, carbamates, certain mushrooms, or other cholinergic agents.\n\nLet's analyze the provided options:\n\nA. Pralidoxime for organophosphate poisoning: Organophosphates inhibit acetylcholinesterase, leading to an accumulation of acetylcholine. This causes cholinergic symptoms such as bradycardia, hypotension, miosis, increased secretions, bronchospasm, and muscle weakness. Atropine is an antidote that blocks the muscarinic effects of acetylcholine, but it does not reactivate the inhibited enzyme. The partial response and recurrence of symptoms with atropine suggest that the underlying enzyme inhibition is not being corrected, which is characteristic of organophosphate poisoning. Pralidoxime is an acetylcholinesterase reactivator and is considered the definitive antidote for organophosphate poisoning, as it addresses the root cause of the excessive acetylcholine.\n\nB. N-acetylcysteine for acetaminophen: Acetaminophen overdose causes hepatotoxicity, not the symptoms described.\n\nC. Flumazenil for benzodiazepine overdose: Benzodiazepine overdose typically causes CNS depression, and while hypotension can occur, miosis and bradycardia are not hallmark features. Flumazenil is the antidote for benzodiazepines but does not fit this clinical picture.\n\nD. Physostigmine for anticholinergic toxicity: Anticholinergic toxicity presents with opposite symptoms: tachycardia, mydriasis (dilated pupils), dry skin, dry mouth, hyperthermia, and delirium. Physostigmine, being an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor itself, would worsen cholinergic symptoms and is used to treat anticholinergic toxicity. This option is incorrect given the patient's symptoms.\n\nE. Hydroxocobalamin for cyanide: Cyanide poisoning can cause cardiovascular collapse, including bradycardia and hypotension, but miosis is not a characteristic finding. While possible, the presentation is more classic for cholinergic excess.\n\nConsidering the symptoms (bradycardia, hypotension, miosis) and the partial response to atropine with recurrence, organophosphate poisoning is the most likely diagnosis among the options that can be definitively treated by one of the listed antidotes.

She is 20 weeks pregnant with twins, which adds complexity due to increased physiological demands on the cardiovascular system. Importantly, she is hemodynamically stable, which allows for planned intervention.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\nA. Percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty (PMBV): This is a minimally invasive procedure that directly addresses the mechanical obstruction of severe mitral stenosis by splitting the fused commissures of the mitral valve. It is generally the preferred interventional modality for symptomatic severe mitral stenosis when the valve morphology is amenable (non-calcified, pliable leaflets). In pregnant patients, PMBV is often favored over open surgery due to lower invasiveness, reduced anesthesia time, and potentially faster recovery, which can be beneficial for both mother and fetuses.\n\nB. Open mitral commissurotomy: This is a more invasive surgical procedure involving open-heart surgery. While effective for treating mitral stenosis, it carries higher risks than PMBV, especially in the context of pregnancy. It is usually considered when PMBV is not feasible.\n\nC. Therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin: Anticoagulation is important in managing mitral stenosis, particularly if atrial fibrillation is present or to prevent thrombus formation. However, it does not correct the underlying severe stenosis and pulmonary hypertension, which are the cause of the patient's acute symptoms.\n\nD. Beta-blocker therapy for rate control: Beta-blockers are useful for controlling heart rate, especially in cases of atrial fibrillation associated with mitral stenosis. However, they do not resolve the severe mechanical obstruction of the valve itself.\n\nE. Termination of pregnancy: This is a radical measure typically reserved for situations where maternal or fetal life is at imminent risk and all other treatment options have failed or are not viable. Since the patient is hemodynamically stable, there is an opportunity to manage her condition through valve intervention, making termination of pregnancy an unlikely first-line approach.\n\nGiven that the patient has severe symptomatic mitral stenosis causing acute shortness of breath and pulmonary hypertension, intervention to relieve the stenosis is necessary. Of the interventional options, PMBV is the least invasive and generally the preferred method in pregnancy, assuming the valve is suitable for the procedure. As the question does not specify contraindications for PMBV, and it is listed as an option, it represents the most appropriate initial management choice.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p04-005", "question": "A 65-year-old man with aortic stenosis undergoes transcatheter aortic valve replacement under monitored anesthesia care.

Elevated lithium levels in the presence of impaired renal function are a cause for concern and require prompt intervention to reduce serum lithium concentrations.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. Hemodialysis: Hemodialysis is a highly effective method for removing lithium from the body, particularly when serum levels are toxic and renal function is compromised. For serum lithium levels above 2.0 mmol/L, especially with signs of toxicity or impaired renal function, hemodialysis is generally indicated for rapid and efficient lithium clearance.\n\nB. Forced diuresis with saline: While hydration and diuresis can help increase lithium excretion, this strategy is significantly less effective than hemodialysis, especially when the patient has acute kidney injury. In AKI, the kidneys are unable to effectively excrete substances like lithium, making forced diuresis suboptimal and potentially risky due to fluid overload.\n\nC. Gastric lavage: This procedure is used to remove ingested substances from the stomach. It is most effective when performed shortly after acute ingestion. In a patient with chronic lithium therapy presenting with symptoms and a high serum level, gastric lavage is unlikely to be beneficial as the lithium has already been absorbed.\n\nD. Activated charcoal administration: Activated charcoal can bind to certain drugs and toxins in the gastrointestinal tract, preventing their absorption. Like gastric lavage, its effectiveness is limited to recent ingestions and is not useful for removing a substance that has already been absorbed into the bloodstream.\n\nE. Discontinuation and observation: Simply stopping lithium and observing is not sufficient in cases of severe toxicity with elevated serum levels and AKI. The lithium will remain in the body for a prolonged period due to impaired renal clearance, and the patient is at risk of further neurological damage or other complications. Active measures are needed to expedite clearance.\n\nGiven the high serum lithium level (2.5 mmol/L), symptomatic toxicity, and acute kidney injury, hemodialysis is the most appropriate and effective intervention to rapidly reduce the lithium burden and prevent further complications.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p04-007", "question": "A 50-year-old woman with Crohn's disease presents with an enterocutaneous fistula after ileocolic resection.

She is hemodynamically stable, which means immediate surgical intervention is not required for life support. The primary goal is to promote spontaneous closure.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\nA. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and somatostatin analog: TPN provides nutritional support while resting the bowel, reducing the workload and stimulating healing. Somatostatin analogs (like octreotide) reduce gastrointestinal secretions and motility, thus decreasing fistula output and promoting closure. This is a well-established conservative management strategy for high-output fistulas, especially those related to inflammatory bowel disease, when the patient is stable and there are no signs of sepsis or distal obstruction.\n\nB. Immediate surgical closure with bowel resection: Surgery is often the definitive treatment for fistulas, particularly in Crohn's disease, but it is typically reserved for cases where conservative management fails, or in patients who are hemodynamically unstable, malnourished, or have complications like uncontrolled sepsis or distal obstruction. For a stable patient with the goal of *promoting spontaneous closure*, this is not the first-line strategy.\n\nC. Antibiotic therapy with abscess drainage: This strategy is indicated when there is evidence of infection, such as an abscess. While antibiotics may be used, their primary role is to treat infection, not to directly promote fistula closure. Abscess drainage is critical if an abscess is present, but the question does not mention an abscess.\n\nD. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has a limited role in the management of enterocutaneous fistulas and is not considered a primary or most effective strategy for promoting spontaneous closure in this context.\n\nE. Fibrin glue injection into the fistula tract: This is a less invasive technique that can be successful for small, low-output fistulas. However, for high-output fistulas, the volume and pressure of drainage often prevent the fibrin glue from effectively sealing the tract and promoting closure.\n\nGiven the patient's presentation (stable, high-output fistula in Crohn's disease), the most effective strategy for promoting spontaneous closure is conservative management aimed at reducing output and facilitating healing.

The CACNA1A mutation is a well-established genetic cause of FHM, specifically FHM Type 1. The question asks for the *most effective* *prophylactic* treatment.\n\nWhile standard migraine prophylactic medications like propranolol, amitriptyline, and valproate are often used for FHM, literature and clinical experience suggest that certain agents may be more consistently effective. Topiramate, an anticonvulsant medication also used for migraine prophylaxis, has shown good efficacy in FHM, often cited as being among the most effective options. Verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, is a standard migraine preventive but is not as consistently highlighted for superior efficacy in FHM compared to topiramate. Importantly, some medications, particularly sodium channel blockers like carbamazepine, are known to worsen FHM symptoms and should be avoided.\n\nBased on available evidence regarding FHM prophylaxis, topiramate is frequently recommended as an effective first-line option.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p04-009", "question": "A 65-year-old man with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy develops sudden syncope during exercise.

Symptoms persist despite beta-blocker therapy, indicating that medical management has been insufficient.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\nA. Surgical septal myectomy: This is a surgical procedure that involves removing thickened septal muscle to relieve LVOT obstruction. It is considered the most effective and definitive treatment for severe, symptomatic obstructive HCM refractory to medical therapy.\n\nB. Alcohol septal ablation: This is an interventional cardiology procedure where alcohol is injected into a septal artery to cause targeted infarction of the hypertrophied septum, reducing the obstruction. It is an alternative to myectomy, often used for patients who are not surgical candidates or prefer a less invasive approach. However, it may be less effective than surgery in achieving complete and durable gradient reduction for severe obstruction and carries risks like complete heart block requiring permanent pacing.\n\nC. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement: Syncope in HCM is a significant risk factor for sudden cardiac death (SCD), primarily due to ventricular arrhythmias. Therefore, ICD placement is crucial for primary prevention of SCD in patients with HCM and risk factors like syncope. However, an ICD treats arrhythmias and does not address the underlying LVOT obstruction. While it may be indicated for SCD prevention in this patient, it does not definitively manage the LVOT obstruction causing the symptoms.\n\nD. Dual-chamber pacing: Pacing can sometimes reduce the LVOT gradient and improve symptoms in selected patients with dynamic obstruction, but it is generally less effective than myectomy or ablation for significant, fixed obstruction.\n\nE. Verapamil initiation: Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker and a first-line medical therapy for symptomatic HCM. However, the patient is already on beta-blocker therapy with persistent symptoms, and verapamil is a medical treatment, not a definitive structural intervention.\n\nThe question asks for the \"most definitive management option\" for a patient with persistent symptomatic LVOT obstruction despite medical therapy. Both surgical myectomy and alcohol septal ablation are definitive treatments for the obstruction. However, surgical septal myectomy is generally considered the gold standard and most definitive procedure for achieving significant and durable relief from severe LVOT obstruction in suitable patients, offering the best chance for complete resolution of obstruction-related symptoms. While an ICD might also be indicated due to the syncope (a risk factor for SCD), the primary focus of the question's description (significant obstruction, failed medical therapy for symptoms) points towards addressing the obstruction directly as the definitive management for the described problem.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_grok-4-0709_p04-010", "question": "A 52-year-old woman with acromegaly undergoes transsphenoidal surgery.

This is a classic presentation of central diabetes insipidus (CDI), resulting from damage to the posterior pituitary or hypothalamus during surgery, leading to a deficiency in antidiuretic hormone (ADH). ADH is crucial for water reabsorption in the kidneys, allowing for the concentration of urine. Without sufficient ADH, the kidneys excrete large volumes of dilute urine, leading to dehydration and hypernatremia.\n\nThe goal of treatment is to replace the missing ADH or mimic its action to reduce urine output and prevent dehydration.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. Desmopressin acetate (DDAVP): This is a synthetic analog of ADH. It acts on the V2 receptors in the renal collecting ducts to increase water reabsorption, thereby reducing urine volume and concentrating the urine. This is the cornerstone treatment for central diabetes insipidus.\n\nB. Hydrochlorothiazide: This is a thiazide diuretic. While thiazides can paradoxically reduce urine volume in patients with diabetes insipidus (both central and nephrogenic) by affecting tubular handling of sodium and water, they are not the initial or primary treatment for CDI. They are more often used for nephrogenic DI or in specific situations where DDAVP is contraindicated or insufficient.\n\nC. Demeclocycline: This antibiotic inhibits the action of ADH on the renal tubules, effectively inducing nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. It is used to treat Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone secretion (SIADH), not diabetes insipidus.\n\nD. Tolvaptan: This is a selective vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist. It blocks the action of ADH, promoting free water excretion. It is used to treat hyponatremia, particularly in conditions like SIADH, which is the opposite of what is needed here.\n\nE. Conivaptan: This is a vasopressin V1A and V2 receptor antagonist, also used for hyponatremia by increasing free water excretion. It is also contraindicated in diabetes insipipidus.\n\nGiven the presentation of central diabetes insipidus, the most appropriate initial pharmacologic intervention is desmopressin acetate to replace the deficient ADH.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}]
