Orthostatic hypotension with sympathetic denervation: This indicates significant autonomic dysfunction, which is a hallmark of synucleinopathies (Lewy body dementia, Multiple system atrophy, Parkinson's disease).\n\n2. Mild cognitive impairment: Present in several conditions listed.\n\n3. Hippocampal atrophy: This is classically associated with Alzheimer's disease, but can also be seen in Lewy body dementia.\n\n4. Recurrent falls: Common in Lewy body dementia, PSP, and conditions with autonomic dysfunction.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n- A. Alzheimer disease with autonomic involvement: AD typically doesn't cause significant autonomic dysfunction or sympathetic denervation. While hippocampal atrophy fits, the autonomic features are atypical.\n\n- B. Lewy body dementia (DLB): Features autonomic dysfunction (including orthostatic hypotension), cognitive impairment, and can have hippocampal atrophy. DLB commonly presents with falls and autonomic symptoms. The combination of cognitive impairment with prominent autonomic dysfunction strongly suggests a synucleinopathy.\n\n- C. Multiple system atrophy (MSA): Has prominent autonomic dysfunction but typically presents with more severe parkinsonism or cerebellar features, and cognitive impairment is usually mild or absent early on. MSA typically shows putaminal or cerebellar atrophy, not primarily hippocampal.\n\n- D. Vascular parkinsonism: Would show vascular changes on MRI, not primarily hippocampal atrophy.\n\n- E. Progressive supranuclear palsy: Causes falls but typically has midbrain atrophy, not hippocampal atrophy, and autonomic dysfunction is less prominent.\n\nThe combination of cognitive impairment (on donepezil), autonomic dysfunction with sympathetic denervation, recurrent falls, and hippocampal atrophy best fits Lewy body dementia.

This gene encodes the α1A subunit of P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels.\n\nFor hemiplegic migraine prophylaxis, the treatment considerations are:\n\n- Verapamil: A calcium channel blocker that is considered first-line for hemiplegic migraine prophylaxis. It directly targets calcium channels, which is particularly relevant given the CACNA1A mutation affects calcium channel function.\n\n- Topiramate: Used for migraine prophylaxis but not specifically preferred for hemiplegic migraine.\n\n- Propranolol: Generally avoided in hemiplegic migraine due to theoretical concerns about worsening aura/hemiplegia.\n\n- Amitriptyline: Can be used but not first-line for hemiplegic migraine.\n\n- Valproate: Can be used for migraine prophylaxis but not the preferred choice for FHM.\n\nGiven that the pathophysiology involves a calcium channel mutation (CACNA1A), verapamil (a calcium channel blocker) is the most logical and effective choice.

Surgical septal myectomy - This is the gold standard treatment for symptomatic HCM with significant LVOT obstruction (≥50 mmHg) refractory to medical therapy. It has excellent long-term outcomes, low mortality in experienced centers, and provides durable relief of obstruction.\n\nB. Alcohol septal ablation - This is an alternative to surgery, typically reserved for patients who are poor surgical candidates or elderly patients. It's less definitive than myectomy with higher rates of complete heart block and potential need for repeat procedures.\n\nC. ICD placement - While this patient may need an ICD for sudden cardiac death prevention (given syncope during exercise), this addresses arrhythmia risk but does NOT treat the LVOT obstruction causing symptoms.\n\nD. Dual-chamber pacing - This has largely fallen out of favor as primary treatment for LVOT obstruction. Studies show modest benefit at best, and it's not considered definitive therapy.\n\nE. Verapamil initiation - This is another medical option, but the question states symptoms persist despite beta-blocker therapy. Adding verapamil might help some patients, but with a gradient of 80 mmHg and syncope, this is unlikely to be sufficient.\n\nThe question asks for the \"most definitive management option\" for LVOT obstruction.
