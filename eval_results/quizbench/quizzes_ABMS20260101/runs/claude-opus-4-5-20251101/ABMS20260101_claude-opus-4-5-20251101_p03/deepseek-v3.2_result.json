Low molecular weight heparin is the preferred anticoagulant over unfractionated heparin in this clinical context because it offers more consistent pharmacokinetic properties and eliminates the need for aPTT monitoring, which lacks reliability in AHA.

Option A poses a contraindication due to thrombotic hazard when emicizumab is combined with anticoagulation. Option B neglects the requirement for anticoagulation in acute pulmonary embolism.
