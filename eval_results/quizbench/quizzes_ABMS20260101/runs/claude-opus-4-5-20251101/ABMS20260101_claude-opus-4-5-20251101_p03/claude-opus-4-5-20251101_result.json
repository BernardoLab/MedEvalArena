The key is understanding how anti-insulin antibodies cause this pattern.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\nA. Antibody-mediated accelerated insulin clearance causing initial hyperglycemia followed by rebound hypoglycemia\n- Accelerated clearance would reduce insulin action, causing hyperglycemia, but wouldn't explain the subsequent severe hypoglycemia.\n\nB. Antibody buffering of exogenous insulin with delayed release causing prolonged insulin action\n- This is the classic mechanism of Insulin Autoimmune Syndrome (IAS) or exogenous insulin antibody syndrome. Antibodies bind insulin, creating a \"reservoir.\" Initially, less free insulin is available (causing hyperglycemia), then antibodies release insulin unpredictably, causing delayed hypoglycemia. This explains the pattern of postprandial hyperglycemia followed by hypoglycemia hours later.\n\nC. Cross-reactivity of anti-insulin antibodies with insulin receptors causing receptor activation\n- Anti-insulin antibodies typically don't cross-react with insulin receptors. This would be a different entity (anti-insulin receptor antibodies).\n\nD. Antibody-induced insulin resistance requiring higher doses with subsequent overdosing\n- While antibodies can cause resistance, the pattern described (rapid drops after meals with specific timing) doesn't fit simple overdosing.\n\nE. Complement-mediated destruction of pancreatic alpha cells reducing glucagon counterregulation\n- This is not a recognized mechanism of anti-insulin antibodies.\n\nThe clinical picture perfectly matches insulin antibody syndrome where antibodies act as a buffer/reservoir. They bind injected insulin initially (reducing its immediate effect, allowing glucose to rise to 180), then release it later in an uncontrolled fashion, causing the delayed hypoglycemia.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p03", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p03-002", "question": "A 52-year-old woman with primary sclerosing cholangitis and ulcerative colitis presents with progressive fatigue and pruritus.

The clinical concern is cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), which is a known complication of PSC.\n\nThe brush cytology shows atypical cells suspicious for malignancy, and FISH analysis demonstrates polysomy. The question asks which additional FISH finding would most strongly support cholangiocarcinoma over reactive atypia.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\nA. Homozygous deletion of 9p21 (CDKN2A/p16)\nThe 9p21 locus contains the CDKN2A gene (p16), which is a tumor suppressor gene. Homozygous deletion of 9p21 is a highly specific marker for malignancy in biliary strictures. This finding is particularly valuable in distinguishing cholangiocarcinoma from reactive/inflammatory changes in PSC patients. The combination of polysomy plus 9p21 deletion significantly increases specificity for malignancy.\n\nB. Trisomy of chromosome 7\nTrisomy 7 can be seen in both malignant and reactive conditions, making it less specific for malignancy.\n\nC. Monosomy of chromosome 17\nWhile chromosomal losses can occur in malignancy, monosomy 17 is not as specific a marker for cholangiocarcinoma.\n\nD. Gain of chromosome 3\nChromosome 3 gains are part of polysomy patterns but are not specifically diagnostic.\n\nE. Deletion of 1p36\nWhile 1p36 deletions occur in various cancers, this is not the most specific marker for biliary malignancy.\n\nThe UroVysion FISH panel adapted for biliary specimens specifically looks for polysomy (gains of chromosomes 3, 7, 17) AND homozygous deletion of 9p21. The 9p21 deletion is particularly important because it represents loss of a tumor suppressor gene and is highly specific for malignancy, helping distinguish true cholangiocarcinoma from reactive atypia that can occur in inflammatory conditions like PSC.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p03", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p03-003", "question": "A 55-year-old man with severe persistent asthma on high-dose inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta-agonist, long-acting muscarinic antagonist, and monthly omalizumab presents with continued poor control.

Given his elevated blood and sputum eosinophils, these could help but only address the IL-5/eosinophil pathway.\n\n- Option A (Dupilumab - anti-IL-4Rα): Blocks both IL-4 and IL-13 signaling. Effective for T2 inflammation, reduces exacerbations, and works on multiple aspects of T2 inflammation including eosinophils and FeNO.\n\n- Option D (Tezepelumab - anti-TSLP): This is an upstream cytokine blocker that works regardless of T2 status. It blocks thymic stromal lymphopoietin, which is released from epithelial cells and initiates the inflammatory cascade. It has shown efficacy in patients who have failed other biologics because it works at a more proximal point in the inflammatory pathway.\n\nKey Consideration:\nThe patient is failing omalizumab despite having T2-high disease.

The chromogenic factor VIII measurements (12% using human reagents) demonstrate ongoing emicizumab activity, though disease remission has not been attained (bovine reagent assay showing 8% with continuing inhibitor presence at 3.8 BU/mL). Low molecular weight heparin is the preferred anticoagulant over unfractionated heparin in this clinical context because it offers more consistent pharmacokinetic properties and eliminates the need for aPTT monitoring, which lacks reliability in AHA.

Amphotericin-resistant Histoplasma - Very rare, and fungal markers are improving, suggesting the treatment is effective. Not likely.\n\nB. Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS) - Wait, the patient is NOT on ART yet. IRIS typically occurs after starting ART. However, there's a phenomenon called \"paradoxical worsening\" or \"unmasking IRIS\" that can occur. But more importantly, this could be a paradoxical reaction to antifungal therapy itself in severely immunocompromised patients.\n\nC. Amphotericin B toxicity - Typically causes nephrotoxicity, electrolyte abnormalities, infusion reactions. The presentation described (fever, hypotension, respiratory worsening) doesn't fit classic amphotericin toxicity pattern.\n\nD. Bacterial superinfection - Blood cultures are negative, making this less likely.\n\nE. Delay ART initiation - This is actually the key point. In patients with severe opportunistic infections and very low CD4 counts, early ART initiation can precipitate IRIS. Guidelines recommend delaying ART for 4-6 weeks in disseminated histoplasmosis to reduce IRIS risk.\n\nRe-evaluation: The question states the patient develops these symptoms on day 3 of amphotericin treatment. If ART hasn't been started yet, this isn't classic IRIS. However, the question asks what intervention is \"most appropriate\" - and option E about delaying ART is a preventive measure, not a treatment for current symptoms.\n\nGiven the clinical picture with improving fungal markers but worsening clinical status, this could represent a paradoxical inflammatory response. Corticosteroids (Option B) would be appropriate treatment for this inflammatory response, even though classic IRIS requires ART initiation.\n\nThe answer is E"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p03", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p03-009", "question": "A 58-year-old woman with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer on trastuzumab deruxtecan develops progressive dyspnea over 4 weeks.
