The central concern is that emicizumab produces thrombin generation via its factor VIIIa-mimetic mechanism, and the concurrent use of emicizumab with therapeutic anticoagulation or additional bypassing agents substantially elevates thrombotic risk. While the patient has an indication for anticoagulation due to pulmonary embolism, emicizumab therapy must first be stopped. The chromogenic factor VIII measurements (12% using human reagents) demonstrate ongoing emicizumab activity, though disease remission has not been attained (bovine reagent assay showing 8% with continuing inhibitor presence at 3.8 BU/mL). Low molecular weight heparin is the preferred anticoagulant over unfractionated heparin in this clinical context because it offers more consistent pharmacokinetic properties and eliminates the need for aPTT monitoring, which lacks reliability in AHA. Augmenting immunosuppressive therapy with rituximab is warranted given the insufficient response to corticosteroids alone after an 8-day period. Option A poses a contraindication due to thrombotic hazard when emicizumab is combined with anticoagulation. Option B neglects the requirement for anticoagulation in acute pulmonary embolism. Option D increases thrombotic risk by maintaining emicizumab alongside IVC filter insertion. Option E employs activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC), which when used with anticoagulation presents severe thrombotic risk, and fondaparinux monitoring would be challenging given the underlying coagulopathy.

Per consensus guidelines, rechallenge may be considered only in patients who experienced Grade 1 ILD that completely resolved both clinically and radiographically. Higher grade ILD (Grade 2-4) is generally considered a contraindication to rechallenge. Anti-drug antibodies, HER2 status, skin testing, and baseline PFTs do not reliably predict ILD recurrence risk. The mechanism of T-DXd-associated ILD is not fully understood but appears related to the topoisomerase I inhibitor payload rather than immune-mediated hypersensitivity.", "generator_model": "claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "seed": 130, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "target_topic": "Medical Oncology", "abms_specialty": "Medical Oncology", "abms_source": "target_topic", "source_label_raw": "Medical Oncology", "source_quiz_id": "20251218T014545383Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed130", "source_question_id": "20251218T014545383Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed130-007", "source_runs_root": "/home/dbernardo/Documents/pyres/MedEvalArena/eval_results/quizbench/quizzes_Jan2026/runs", "source_run_dir": "/home/dbernardo/Documents/pyres/MedEvalArena/eval_results/quizbench/quizzes_Jan2026/runs/claude-opus-4-5-20251101/20251218T014545383Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed130", "source_quiz_path": "/home/dbernardo/Documents/pyres/MedEvalArena/quizzes/quizzes_Jan2026/20251218T014545383Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed130.jsonl", "pred": "A", "model_outputs": "The answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p03", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p03-010", "question": "A 42-year-old woman with a history of chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps presents with new-onset asthma requiring systemic corticosteroids. She reports severe reactions to aspirin and ibuprofen characterized by bronchospasm and nasal congestion. She requires hip replacement surgery and the orthopedic surgeon requests clearance for perioperative ketorolac use. After shared decision-making, aspirin desensitization is planned. During the desensitization protocol, she develops bronchospasm at the 60 mg aspirin dose. Which mediator's urinary metabolite would be most elevated during this reaction?", "options": ["Leukotriene E4", "Prostaglandin D2 (as 11β-prostaglandin F2α)", "Histamine (as N-methylhistamine)", "Tryptase", "Platelet-activating factor"], "answer": "A", "answer_index": 0, "explanation": "Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is characterized by overproduction of cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) due to dysregulated arachidonic acid metabolism. During aspirin-induced reactions in AERD, urinary leukotriene E4 (LTE4), the stable end-metabolite of CysLTs, increases dramatically (often 3-10 fold). This distinguishes AERD from IgE-mediated reactions where prostaglandin D2 metabolites and histamine metabolites predominate. Tryptase elevation suggests mast cell degranulation in anaphylaxis but is not characteristic of AERD reactions. The CysLT pathway is the primary driver of bronchoconstriction in AERD.", "generator_model": "claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "seed": 130, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "target_topic": "Allergy/Immunology", "abms_specialty": "Allergy/Immunology", "abms_source": "target_topic", "source_label_raw": "Allergy/Immunology", "source_quiz_id": "20251218T014545383Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed130", "source_question_id": "20251218T014545383Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed130-008", "source_runs_root": "/home/dbernardo/Documents/pyres/MedEvalArena/eval_results/quizbench/quizzes_Jan2026/runs", "source_run_dir": "/home/dbernardo/Documents/pyres/MedEvalArena/eval_results/quizbench/quizzes_Jan2026/runs/claude-opus-4-5-20251101/20251218T014545383Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed130", "source_quiz_path": "/home/dbernardo/Documents/pyres/MedEvalArena/quizzes/quizzes_Jan2026/20251218T014545383Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed130.jsonl", "pred": "A", "model_outputs": "The answer is (A)"}]
