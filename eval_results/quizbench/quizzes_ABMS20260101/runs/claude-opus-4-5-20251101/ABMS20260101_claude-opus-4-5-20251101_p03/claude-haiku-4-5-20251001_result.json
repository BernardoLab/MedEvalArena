Antibody buffering of exogenous insulin with delayed release causing prolonged insulin action\n- Anti-insulin antibodies can bind exogenous insulin, creating a reservoir\n- This delays initial insulin action (explaining initial hyperglycemia at 180 mg/dL)\n- As antibody-bound insulin is gradually released, it causes prolonged and unpredictable insulin action\n- This leads to delayed, prolonged hypoglycemia 3-4 hours postprandially\n- The rapid drops occur because of the delayed release of buffered insulin\n- This matches the clinical presentation perfectly\n\nC.
