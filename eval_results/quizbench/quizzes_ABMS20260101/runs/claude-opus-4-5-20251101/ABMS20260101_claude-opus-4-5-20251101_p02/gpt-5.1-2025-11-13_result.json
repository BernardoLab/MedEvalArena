Echocardiography reveals a resting left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient of 85 mmHg, systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve, and septal thickness of 22 mm. Coronary angiography shows a large first septal perforator arising from the left anterior descending artery supplying the basal septum. She is referred for alcohol septal ablation.

The appropriate step is to reposition the balloon more distally to exclude the branch supplying the papillary muscle. Proceeding with injection (A) or reducing volume (D) risks catastrophic mitral regurgitation. Aborting immediately (B) is premature before attempting repositioning.
