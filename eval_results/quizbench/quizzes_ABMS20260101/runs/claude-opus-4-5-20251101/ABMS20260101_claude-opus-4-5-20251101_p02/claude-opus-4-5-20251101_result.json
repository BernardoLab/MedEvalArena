Mean dose to the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle >60 Gy\nThe pharyngeal constrictor muscles are critical for swallowing. The superior pharyngeal constrictor (SPC) is particularly important in the pharyngeal phase of swallowing. Multiple studies (including QUANTEC data) have shown that mean dose to the pharyngeal constrictors, especially the superior constrictor, strongly correlates with late dysphagia and aspiration risk.\n\nB. Maximum dose to the larynx >70 Gy\nWhile laryngeal dose matters for aspiration, the maximum dose is less predictive than mean doses to swallowing structures. The larynx is important but the primary issue here is pharyngeal dysmotility.\n\nC. Mean dose to the parotid glands >26 Gy\nThis threshold relates to xerostomia, not dysphagia/aspiration. While xerostomia can contribute to swallowing difficulties, it doesn't cause the severe pharyngeal dysmotility and fibrosis described.\n\nD. Volume of oral cavity receiving >40 Gy\nOral cavity dose relates more to mucositis and taste changes rather than pharyngeal dysmotility and aspiration.\n\nE. Mean dose to the cervical esophagus >45 Gy\nThis relates more to esophageal stricture and dysphagia in the esophageal phase, not the pharyngeal dysmotility and aspiration described.\n\nThe clinical picture describes pharyngeal phase dysfunction with fibrosis of the pharyngeal muscles and reduced epiglottic deflection - this is most strongly associated with radiation dose to the pharyngeal constrictor muscles. The superior pharyngeal constrictor is often in the high-dose region for oropharyngeal cancers, and doses >60 Gy to this structure have been shown to significantly increase risk of severe late dysphagia.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p02", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p02-008", "question": "A 71-year-old man undergoes right pneumonectomy for centrally located squamous cell carcinoma.

They mechanically anchor the graft to the aortic wall and can be effective for short necks and angulated anatomy. This is an endovascular solution that addresses the specific problem.\n\nC. Conversion to open repair: This is definitive but carries significant morbidity/mortality. It's typically reserved when endovascular options are exhausted.\n\nD. Aortic extension cuff with suprarenal fixation: The neck is already short (11 mm), so adding an extension cuff won't provide additional seal zone length proximally.
