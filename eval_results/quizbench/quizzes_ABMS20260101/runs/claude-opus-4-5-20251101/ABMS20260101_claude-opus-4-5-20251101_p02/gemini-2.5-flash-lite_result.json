Biopsy reveals atypical lymphoid infiltrate characterized by a CD4+ immunophenotype, absence of CD8 expression, and loss of CD7 expression, along with a monoclonal T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement. PET-CT shows no evidence of systemic disease.\n\nLet's analyze the findings:\n1.  Atypical lymphoid infiltrate with monoclonal TCR gene rearrangement: This indicates a malignant proliferation of T-cells (lymphoma).\n2.  CD4+ immunophenotype: This identifies the lymphoma as a T-cell lymphoma, specifically derived from CD4+ helper T-cells.\n3.  Loss of CD7 expression: This is a significant finding, as loss of CD7 expression is a hallmark aberrant immunophenotype frequently observed in cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs), particularly Mycosis Fungoides (MF).\n4.  No evidence of systemic disease on PET-CT: This strongly suggests that the lymphoma is confined to the skin, classifying it as a \"primary cutaneous\" lymphoma.\n5.  15-year history of dermatomyositis (DM): While DM is an autoimmune condition, patients with DM have an increased risk of developing lymphomas. The current lesion is distinct from the typical inflammation of DM.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options:\n\nA.  This represents transformation of dermatomyositis to systemic T-cell lymphoma requiring CHOP chemotherapy. The PET-CT explicitly states \"no evidence of systemic disease,\" which refutes the diagnosis of systemic lymphoma. Therefore, this option is inaccurate.\n\nB.  This is a primary cutaneous CD4+ small/medium T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder with excellent prognosis. This statement aligns well with the findings. It is \"primary cutaneous\" (no systemic disease), it is a \"CD4+ T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder\" (based on immunophenotype and clonality), and \"small/medium\" describes the typical cell size in many CTCLs including early-stage MF. Early-stage, localized CTCLs generally have an excellent prognosis.\n\nC.  The dermatomyositis was likely a paraneoplastic phenomenon of an underlying T-cell lymphoma. This is less likely. The DM has a 15-year history, and the current lesion is a new development over 8 months. If the DM were paraneoplastic for a systemic lymphoma, one would expect to see evidence of systemic disease on the PET-CT, which is absent. It's more plausible that a CTCL has developed in a patient with a history of chronic skin inflammation from DM, or independently.\n\nD.  This represents mycosis fungoides arising in the setting of chronic inflammation requiring total skin electron beam therapy. Mycosis fungoides is the most common type of CTCL and the immunophenotype (CD4+, loss of CD7) is highly characteristic of MF. The history of DM introduces chronic skin inflammation. However, \"requiring total skin electron beam therapy (TSEA)\" is a treatment modality typically reserved for more widespread cutaneous involvement (e.g., stages Ib-IIb MF). A single 2.5 cm plaque represents very early-stage disease (likely Stage IA of MF) which would not typically require TSEA, but rather localized therapies such as topical agents, phototherapy, or localized radiation. Thus, the treatment recommendation makes this statement less accurate overall.\n\nE.  Immediate allogeneic stem cell transplantation is indicated given the immunocompromised state. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a highly aggressive treatment reserved for advanced, refractory, or high-risk lymphomas. The current presentation is of a localized cutaneous lesion with no systemic disease, indicating early-stage disease. There is no definitive information stating the patient is severely immunocompromised requiring such immediate intervention.\n\nComparing options B and D, option B provides a more accurate and broadly applicable description of the patient's condition without including a potentially incorrect treatment indication, as seen in option D. The findings strongly support a primary cutaneous CD4+ T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder. Given the localized nature (single plaque, no systemic disease), the prognosis is indeed excellent for this stage.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p02", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p02-002", "question": "A 67-year-old man undergoes robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for Gleason 4+3=7 prostate cancer.

The PSMA-PET scan reveals a single 8mm focus of uptake in the right obturator lymph node, indicating a solitary nodal metastasis.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. Observation with serial PSA monitoring until symptomatic progression: This is generally not recommended for detected recurrence, especially with imaging evidence of metastatic disease, as early intervention often leads to better oncologic outcomes.\n\nB. Androgen deprivation therapy alone for 24 months: ADT is primarily used to control advanced or metastatic prostate cancer and is not typically curative as a sole treatment for a single nodal recurrence, especially when other curative-intent options are available. Its use in this context would be more for palliation or in combination with radiation.\n\nC. Salvage radiation therapy to the prostate bed alone (66-70 Gy): This addresses the positive surgical margin but fails to treat the identified nodal metastasis, which is a critical site of recurrence.\n\nD. Salvage radiation therapy to prostate bed plus elective nodal irradiation with short-term ADT: This strategy is comprehensive. Salvage radiation to the prostate bed addresses the residual cancer from the positive apical margin. Elective nodal irradiation (ENI) covers the anatomical regions at risk for lymphatic spread, which includes the obturator region where the PSMA-avid node is located. Short-term ADT is often used concurrently with radiation in recurrent settings to enhance treatment efficacy. This option addresses both the local residual disease risk and the detected nodal recurrence.\n\nE. Stereotactic body radiation therapy to the PSMA-avid lymph node alone: This is a form of metastasis-directed therapy focused on the identified nodal metastasis. However, it does not address the positive apical surgical margin, leaving potential residual disease in the prostate bed untreated, which could lead to local failure or further spread.\n\nBased on current evidence, when a patient has both residual disease at the prostate bed (indicated by positive margins) and a detectable metastatic lesion (e.g., a single lymph node on PSMA-PET) signifying oligometastatic disease, a multimodal approach that addresses all known sites of disease is often favored for achieving the best oncologic outcome.

The presence of cartilage invasion makes this at least T4a, and the nodal disease suggests N2 or N3. The smoking history is a classic risk factor.\n\nFor locoregionally advanced hypopharyngeal cancer with the goal of organ preservation and cure, several treatment strategies exist.\n\nA.  Total laryngopharyngectomy with bilateral neck dissection and free flap reconstruction: This is a radical surgical approach. While effective for cure, it results in significant morbidity (loss of voice, major swallowing impairment). It is typically reserved for unresectable tumors, persistent disease after non-operative management, or when organ preservation has failed or is not feasible. Given that M0 disease is present, an attempt at organ preservation is usually favored as an initial step if possible.\n\nB.  Definitive chemoradiation with cisplatin-based concurrent chemotherapy: This is a well-established organ-preservation strategy and is highly effective for many head and neck cancers, including hypopharyngeal SCC. However, for very advanced disease (T4a, significant nodal involvement), outcomes might be further improved with induction chemotherapy.\n\nC.  Induction chemotherapy with TPF followed by chemoradiation for responders: TPF (cisplatin, fluorouracil, and docetaxel) is a potent induction chemotherapy regimen that has demonstrated improved survival and organ preservation rates compared to definitive chemoradiation alone in selected patients with locoregionally advanced hypopharyngeal and laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. It aims to downstage the disease, increase the likelihood of organ preservation, and select patients who are likely to benefit from subsequent aggressive treatment. If a patient responds well to induction chemotherapy, they proceed to concurrent chemoradiation. Those who do not respond may be considered for surgery. This approach is often considered the most appropriate initial management for patients with locally advanced hypopharyngeal cancer aiming for organ preservation.\n\nD.  Transoral robotic surgery with adjuvant radiation therapy: While minimally invasive techniques like transoral robotic surgery (TORS) are increasingly used for head and neck cancers, the extent of this tumor (4.2 cm, cartilage invasion, extension to postcricoid region, vocal cord fixation) likely exceeds the typical limits for successful TORS alone. Such extensive disease in the hypopharynx often still requires significant pharyngeal reconstruction even with minimally invasive approaches, and it may not be the primary initial strategy for a large, invasive tumor.\n\nE.  Larynx-preservation protocol with carboplatin/paclitaxel and radiation: Concurrent chemoradiation with platinum-based agents is standard. Carboplatin/paclitaxel is an alternative regimen, often considered for patients who cannot tolerate cisplatin due to comorbidities or age. While it's an organ-preservation strategy, TPF induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation is generally considered a more aggressive and potentially more effective approach for *advanced-stage* disease (as seen here with cartilage invasion and fixation) to maximize cure and organ preservation.\n\nConsidering the patient's advanced stage (T4a, N2b/N3, M0), induction chemotherapy with TPF followed by chemoradiation for responders (Option C) is widely recognized as the most appropriate initial management strategy to optimize outcomes and organ preservation.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p02", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p02-004", "question": "A 42-year-old woman with multiple sclerosis presents for evaluation of neurogenic bladder.

Urodynamic studies reveal detrusor overactivity (DO) with detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia (DSD), a high maximum detrusor pressure of 65 cmH2O during involuntary contractions, and a significant post-void residual (PVR) of 280 mL. Mild bilateral hydronephrosis is present, indicating upper tract compromise due to elevated intravesical pressures during bladder storage or voiding. The patient's current management with clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) and oxybutynin TID has failed to provide adequate symptom control and has resulted in intolerable anticholinergic side effects.\n\nThe goal is to identify the intervention that provides the MOST durable improvement in upper tract protection while maintaining quality of life.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. Increase anticholinergic dose with addition of mirabegron: Given that oxybutynin is causing intolerable side effects, increasing the dose is not a viable solution for improving symptom control or quality of life. While mirabegron can help with DO, this pharmacological approach may not be sufficient to adequately reduce the high detrusor pressures (65 cmH2O) and protect the upper tracts, especially with co-existing DSD and significant PVR. It is also not the most durable solution.\n\nB. Sacral neuromodulation with InterStim device: Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) is effective for treating neurogenic DO and can help improve bladder storage, reduce urgency and frequency, and potentially address DSD by modulating neural control. It can lead to improved bladder compliance and reduced detrusor pressures, thereby protecting the upper tracts. SNM offers a durable solution, is adjustable, and generally well-tolerated, contributing to good quality of life. It is a strong contender for management of neurogenic bladder in MS.\n\nC. Intradetrusor onabotulinumtoxinA injection 200 units: OnabotulinumtoxinA is highly effective in reducing DO and can significantly lower detrusor pressures, offering good protection for the upper tracts. It can also help with DSD. However, its durability is limited, requiring repeat injections every 6-9 months. While effective for temporary relief and protection, it is not as \"durable\" as a surgically implanted device or reconstructive surgery for long-term, maximal protection.\n\nD. Augmentation cystoplasty with continent catheterizable channel: Augmentation cystoplasty involves surgically increasing bladder capacity with bowel segments, creating a low-pressure reservoir. This procedure directly addresses severe bladder storage dysfunction, high detrusor pressures, and risk of upper tract damage. Coupled with a continent catheterizable channel (e.g., Mitrofanoff), it allows for efficient bladder emptying and improved continence, significantly enhancing quality of life. This is considered a highly durable and effective intervention for preventing renal deterioration in patients with severe neurogenic bladder who have failed less invasive treatments. Given the presence of hydronephrosis and high detrusor pressure, augmentation cystoplasty offers the most robust and durable protection for the upper urinary tracts.\n\nE. Sphincterotomy with condom catheter drainage: Sphincterotomy is primarily used to relieve DSD in patients with low bladder pressures and poor emptying. In this patient with high detrusor pressures (65 cmH2O), sphincterotomy would worsen incontinence and fail to address the underlying issue of overactivity and high storage pressures, thus not protecting the upper tracts; it would likely exacerbate renal compromise. Condom catheter drainage is typically for male incontinence.\n\nComparing options B and D for \"MOST durable improvement in upper tract protection\":\nWhile SNM (B) is a durable and effective treatment that improves quality of life, augmentation cystoplasty (D) provides a more definitive and robust solution for managing severe bladder dysfunction with high pressures and significant risk to the upper tracts, as evidenced by the hydronephrosis. Augmentation cystoplasty directly reconstructs the bladder to create a large, low-pressure reservoir, offering the highest degree of durable protection against renal damage.

The primary risk post-revision is the re-thrombosis of the venous anastomosis, leading to flap failure. We need to identify the adjunctive measure with the strongest evidence for improving flap salvage in this specific situation.\n\nA. Systemic heparinization with aPTT goal 60-80 seconds: Heparin is a potent anticoagulant used to prevent the formation and propagation of blood clots. Following the revision of a venous anastomosis, the risk of re-thrombosis is significant. Systemic heparinization, aiming for a therapeutic aPTT range (60-80 seconds is a common target for therapeutic anticoagulation), directly addresses this risk by preventing the clot cascade. This is a standard and widely supported intervention in preventing venous graft occlusion and improving flap salvage after a thrombotic event.\n\nB. Application of medicinal leeches to the flap surface: Leeches are used to relieve venous congestion and promote venous outflow by aspirating stagnant blood and releasing hirudin (an anticoagulant) and vasoactive substances. They are highly effective for managing venous congestion and improving microcirculation when surgical revision alone is insufficient or when there is persistent venous stasis. While beneficial for venous congestion, their primary role is to manage the *consequences* of impaired outflow or assist in *post-operative* venous drainage rather than directly preventing the *re-thrombosis* of the anastomosis itself, although improved venous return indirectly aids salvage.\n\nC. Topical nitroglycerin paste to the flap skin paddle: Topical nitroglycerin is a vasodilator that can improve microvascular blood flow. It is more typically used to address arterial vasospasm or improve perfusion in cases of arterial insufficiency. It does not directly prevent venous thrombosis or improve venous outflow from a compromised anastomosis.\n\nD. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy at 2.4 ATA for 90 minutes daily: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy increases tissue oxygen levels and can be beneficial for ischemic flaps (arterial insufficiency) or to promote angiogenesis. Its role in managing acute venous congestion or preventing venous anastomosis re-thrombosis is not well-established and is not considered a primary adjunctive therapy for this specific problem.\n\nE. Intravenous dextran-40 infusion at 25 mL/hour: Dextran is a plasma expander that can also reduce platelet aggregation and blood viscosity, theoretically improving microcirculation and preventing small clot formation. However, its use has declined due to potential side effects, and its evidence for preventing major venous anastomosis re-thrombosis is generally considered less robust than that of systemic heparinization.\n\nComparing the options, systemic heparinization (A) directly targets the primary risk factor for flap failure following venous anastomosis thrombosis and revision: re-thrombosis of the anastomosis. It is a cornerstone of management in such situations, with strong evidence supporting its use to maintain patency of venous structures and improve flap salvage rates. While leeches (B) are valuable for managing venous congestion, heparinization is more directly aimed at preventing the recurrence of the thrombotic event that caused the initial failure.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p02", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p02-006", "question": "A 45-year-old woman presents with a 6-month history of progressive right arm weakness and numbness.

This morphology is characteristic of nerve sheath tumors (e.g., schwannoma, neurofibroma). The extension through the neural foramen creates both an intradural component and an extradural component. The goal is to achieve optimal tumor resection while minimizing spinal instability.\n\nLet's analyze the surgical approaches:\n\nA. Posterior laminectomy with tumor resection and instrumented fusion: A laminectomy, especially a wide one, can lead to significant spinal instability. While it provides access to the intradural component, it may require substantial retraction of the spinal cord to reach the lateral and foraminal extension. Instrumented fusion adds further invasiveness to address the instability.\n\nB. Anterior corpectomy with tumor resection and cage reconstruction: This approach is typically used for tumors located anterior to the spinal cord or vertebral body. This tumor is described as lateral to the spinal cord and extending through the neural foramen, making an anterior approach suboptimal for accessing the primary mass components and the extradural extension. Additionally, corpectomy inherently destabilizes the spine.\n\nC. Combined posterior laminectomy and anterior corpectomy in staged procedures: This is a highly invasive approach and is generally reserved for complex tumors involving multiple compartments or extensive bone involvement. For a single dumbbell tumor, even if significant, this is likely excessive and carries a high risk of morbidity and instability.\n\nD. Posterior laminoplasty with tumor resection preserving facet joints: Laminoplasty involves hinging open the lamina. While it preserves more posterior stability than laminectomy, it often provides less direct access to laterally located masses and their foraminal extensions compared to a posterolateral approach. It is more commonly used for spinal stenosis where the compression is central or circumferential.\n\nE. Posterolateral approach with hemilaminectomy and partial facetectomy: This approach targets the lateral aspect of the spinal canal and the neural foramen directly. A hemilaminectomy (removing only one side of the lamina) preserves the contralateral posterior elements, thus maintaining greater spinal stability than a full laminectomy. Partial facetectomy can facilitate access to the neural foramen and the extradural portion of the dumbbell tumor. This approach allows for efficient dissection of the tumor's intradural and extradural components with less spinal cord retraction and a lower risk of instability compared to a full laminectomy. This is considered the optimal approach for laterally located cervical dumbbell tumors.\n\nTherefore, the posterolateral approach with hemilaminectomy and partial facetectomy provides the best balance between achieving complete tumor resection and minimizing spinal instability for this specific tumor presentation.\n\nThe answer is (E)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p02", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p02-007", "question": "A 68-year-old man with HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (T2N1M0, p16+) is treated with definitive intensity-modulated radiation therapy (70 Gy in 35 fractions) with concurrent cisplatin.

These symptoms and signs indicate functional impairment and structural changes in the pharyngeal muscles and related structures, which are crucial for swallowing.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\nA. Mean dose to the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle >60 Gy: The pharyngeal constrictor muscles are primarily responsible for the pharyngeal phase of swallowing, which involves propelling the bolus from the pharynx towards the esophagus. Radiation-induced fibrosis in these muscles can lead to reduced contractility, impaired peristalsis (dysmotility), and difficulty in clearing the pharynx, resulting in aspiration. A mean dose exceeding 60 Gy to these muscles is well-recognized as a significant risk factor for severe dysphagia and fibrosis.\n\nB. Maximum dose to the larynx >70 Gy: While high doses to the larynx can cause dysphonia and potentially contribute to aspiration through impaired airway protection, the primary findings described (pharyngeal fibrosis, dysmotility, reduced epiglottic deflection) point more directly to the pathology within the pharynx itself rather than the larynx.\n\nC. Mean dose to the parotid glands >26 Gy: Radiation to the parotid glands leads to xerostomia (dry mouth), which significantly impairs oral bolus preparation and lubrication, exacerbating swallowing difficulties. However, xerostomia is a different mechanism than direct muscular fibrosis and dysmotility of the pharynx. While xerostomia contributes to dysphagia, the specific findings of pharyngeal fibrosis and dysmotility suggest a direct effect on pharyngeal muscles.\n\nD. Volume of oral cavity receiving >40 Gy: Radiation to the oral cavity affects taste, salivation within the mouth, and the ability to form and move the bolus orally. This constitutes the oral phase of swallowing. The described complications are primarily related to the pharyngeal phase.\n\nE. Mean dose to the cervical esophagus >45 Gy: Radiation to the cervical esophagus can lead to esophagitis, strictures, and dysmotility in the esophagus itself, affecting bolus transit from the pharynx downwards. However, the findings of pharyngeal fibrosis and reduced epiglottic deflection point to a problem originating in the pharynx, above the main segment of the cervical esophagus.\n\nAmong the given options, the dose delivered to the pharyngeal constrictor muscles is the most direct predictor of severe pharyngeal dysmotility and fibrosis leading to aspiration.

Immediate completion thoracoplasty with muscle flap coverage: A thoracoplasty is a major surgical procedure. While it can be used to manage chronic empyema and close large defects, performing it *immediately* on a patient who has just developed this complication might be too aggressive. It is typically considered when less invasive methods fail or for specific indications of pleural space obliteration.\n\nB.  Open window thoracostomy (Eloesser flap) with delayed stump repair: An open window thoracostomy creates a controlled, drained opening into the pleural space. This is a highly effective method for managing large, infected empyemas and can be life-saving. It allows for continuous drainage, irrigation, and control of the infection, which is critical in this case. Delaying definitive stump repair until the infection is controlled and the surrounding tissues are healthier is a standard approach for managing significant BPF with empyema.\n\nC.  Endoscopic stump closure with fibrin glue and covered stent placement: Endoscopic techniques can be useful for smaller or contained fistulas. However, a 1.5 cm dehiscence is a substantial defect. While fibrin glue and stents can augment healing, they may not be sufficient to seal such a large opening, especially in the presence of a gross empyema requiring drainage. This might be considered in less severe cases or as an adjunct, but likely not the *most* appropriate initial strategy here.\n\nD.  Chest tube drainage with broad-spectrum antibiotics and observation: Chest tube drainage and antibiotics are essential initial steps for managing empyema and infection. However, they do not adequately address the 1.5 cm bronchial stump dehiscence, which represents a significant air leak and potential for prolonged contamination. \"Observation\" alone for the dehiscence is insufficient given its size. This option represents the first phase of management but not the complete strategy for resolving the BPF.\n\nE.  Transsternal transpericardial bronchial stump re-closure: This involves a highly invasive approach (sternotomy). While it can be used for stump revision, it's generally not the preferred initial management for a BPF with an empyema that has developed acutely. It is a more complex procedure, and the emphasis in this case is on controlling the large empyema and the fistula.\n\nConsidering the severity of the complication (large dehiscence and empyema), option B offers the most appropriate management strategy. It prioritizes controlling the life-threatening empyema through continuous drainage via an open window, while also allowing for the possibility of delayed definitive repair of the bronchial stump once the infection is under control.

This is a common complication, especially in patients with challenging anatomy, such as a short or angulated aortic neck. In this case, the proximal neck is 11 mm in length with 45-degree angulation and a 28 mm diameter, which are factors that can contribute to poor sealing. Multiple attempts at ballooning the proximal seal zone failed to resolve the endoleak, indicating that the graft is not adequately sealed to the aortic wall.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Placement of a Palmaz stent at the proximal seal zone: Palmaz stents are bare metal stents that can be deployed to reinforce a stent graft or compress it against the aortic wall. While it might help in some cases, it's not the primary treatment for seal failure in a challenging neck and can sometimes be associated with complications.\n\nB. Deployment of endoanchors (HeliFlex) at the proximal neck: Endoanchors are bipolar anchoring devices designed specifically to improve the seal and stability of stent grafts in challenging proximal neck anatomy, such as short, angulated, or diseased necks. They physically anchor the graft fabric to the aortic wall, directly addressing the mechanism of a type Ia endoleak when standard sealing methods fail. This is considered an effective endovascular salvage option for persistent type Ia endoleaks in suitable anatomy.\n\nC. Conversion to open surgical repair: Conversion to open surgery is a definitive treatment for persistent endoleaks that cannot be managed endovascularly. However, it is a major surgical procedure with higher morbidity and mortality compared to a successful endovascular repair. It is generally considered a salvage option when all feasible endovascular interventions have failed or are not possible.\n\nD. Placement of an aortic extension cuff with suprarenal fixation: An aortic extension cuff is used to extend the sealing zone of the stent graft. Suprarenal fixation means the graft is anchored above the renal arteries. This is a more aggressive endovascular approach, typically reserved for cases where the infrarenal neck is anatomically unsuitable for adequate sealing, due to severe angulation, extensive thrombus, or being too short. While it could potentially seal the leak, it carries the risk of occluding or compromising visceral and renal arteries and is usually not the first choice if infrarenal components can be successfully anchored, even with adjunctive devices.\n\nE. Completion of procedure with planned surveillance and secondary intervention: A type Ia endoleak is considered a significant endoleak that poses a substantial risk of AAA sac enlargement and rupture. Leaving a persistent type Ia endoleak untreated with only planned surveillance is generally not appropriate and is associated with poor outcomes.\n\nGiven that ballooning has failed and the neck anatomy is challenging, endoanchors (option B) represent the most appropriate next step.
