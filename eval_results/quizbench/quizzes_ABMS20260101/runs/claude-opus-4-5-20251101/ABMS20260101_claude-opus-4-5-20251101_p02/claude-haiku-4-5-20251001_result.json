Approach options:\n   - Anterior corpectomy (B, C): Not ideal for lateral intradural extramedullary tumors; better for ventral lesions. Would cause unnecessary vertebral body removal and instability.\n   \n   - Posterior laminectomy (A): Adequate for access but removes posterior elements, risking instability. Fusion would be unnecessary for this benign tumor.\n   \n   - Laminoplasty (D): Preserves posterior elements and stability, but the lateral location with foraminal extension may limit adequate exposure.\n   \n   - Posterolateral hemilaminectomy with partial facetectomy (E): This approach:\n     - Provides excellent access to lateral intradural extramedullary lesions\n     - Allows visualization of the nerve root and tumor\n     - Minimal removal of posterior elements\n     - Preserves spinal stability (no fusion needed)\n     - Adequate for foraminal extension\n     - Ideal for nerve sheath tumors\n\nAnswer Rationale:\nFor a lateral intradural extramedullary tumor with foraminal extension, the posterolateral hemilaminectomy with partial facetectomy provides optimal exposure while preserving spinal stability. This approach is the gold standard for lateral nerve sheath tumors and avoids unnecessary fusion or extensive bone removal.\n\nThe answer is (E)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p02", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p02-007", "question": "A 68-year-old man with HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (T2N1M0, p16+) is treated with definitive intensity-modulated radiation therapy (70 Gy in 35 fractions) with concurrent cisplatin.
