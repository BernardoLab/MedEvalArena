Nephrotic syndrome and lithium: Lithium can cause renal issues, and increasing the dose in someone with new nephrotic syndrome is concerning.\n\nEvaluating Options:\n\nA. Increase lithium to 1.2 mEq/L - Risky given new nephrotic syndrome; higher lithium levels could worsen renal function.\n\nB. Add valproic acid - Could help with mania, but doesn't address the underlying cause (steroid-induced). Also has its own side effect profile.\n\nC. Add olanzapine 10 mg - Atypical antipsychotics are effective for acute mania and can be added quickly. This provides rapid symptom control while the steroid situation is managed.\n\nD. Discontinue prednisone and switch to cyclosporine - While addressing the cause, abruptly stopping prednisone is dangerous (adrenal insufficiency), and cyclosporine has significant drug interactions with lithium and its own psychiatric side effects.\n\nE. Add lamotrigine - Lamotrigine requires slow titration (weeks to months) and is primarily for bipolar depression, not acute mania.\n\nBest Answer:\nThe patient needs acute management of manic symptoms. Olanzapine is FDA-approved for acute mania, works quickly, and can be safely added. While the prednisone is likely the trigger, abrupt discontinuation is not safe, and the nephrologist should be consulted about tapering. Adding an antipsychotic provides immediate symptom control.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p04-007", "question": "A 52-year-old woman with BMI 48 kg/m² undergoes laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.

Inducible orthodromic AVRT\n- This confirms the pathway participates in tachycardia but doesn't specifically indicate high risk for sudden cardiac death.\n\nC.

A SPERRI of 220 ms indicates the accessory pathway can conduct very rapidly during atrial fibrillation, potentially leading to ventricular fibrillation. This is a Class I indication for catheter ablation.\n\nE. Decremental conduction properties\n- Decremental conduction actually suggests a SAFER pathway (like in PJRT or atriofascicular pathways), as it means the pathway slows with faster rates, reducing the risk of rapid ventricular response during AF.\n\nThe SPERRI of 220 ms is the strongest indicator of high risk for sudden cardiac death, making catheter ablation strongly recommended.
