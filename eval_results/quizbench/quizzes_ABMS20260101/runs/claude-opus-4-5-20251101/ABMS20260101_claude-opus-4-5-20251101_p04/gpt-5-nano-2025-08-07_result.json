SPERRI ≤250 ms indicates high-risk pathway capable of conducting AF at rates that could degenerate to ventricular fibrillation, strongly favoring ablation. Accessory pathway ERP (A) is less predictive than SPERRI. Inducible orthodromic AVRT (B) and pathway location (C) don't indicate sudden death risk. Decremental properties (E) actually suggest lower risk.", "generator_model": "claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "seed": 123, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "target_topic": "Cardiovascular", "abms_specialty": "Cardiovascular", "abms_source": "topics_mapped", "source_label_raw": "cardiology", "source_quiz_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed123", "source_question_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed123-010", "source_runs_root": "/home/dbernardo/Documents/pyres/MedEvalArena/eval_results/quizbench/quizzes_Jan2026/runs", "source_run_dir": "/home/dbernardo/Documents/pyres/MedEvalArena/eval_results/quizbench/quizzes_Jan2026/runs/claude-opus-4-5-20251101/20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed123", "source_quiz_path": "/home/dbernardo/Documents/pyres/MedEvalArena/quizzes/quizzes_Jan2026/20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed123.jsonl", "pred": "D", "model_outputs": "The answer is (D)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p04-010", "question": "A 52-year-old man with type 2 diabetes presents for evaluation of recurrent hypoglycemia occurring 3-4 hours postprandially. He underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass 2 years ago with 45 kg weight loss. During a symptomatic episode, laboratory studies show: glucose 38 mg/dL, insulin 45 μU/mL (elevated), C-peptide 8.2 ng/mL (elevated), proinsulin 22 pmol/L (elevated), and negative sulfonylurea screen. Calcium-stimulated angiography localizes insulin secretion to the body and tail of the pancreas.

Unlike insulinoma, this involves diffuse islet cell hyperfunction. First-line management is dietary modification (low glycemic index, frequent small meals) combined with acarbose to slow carbohydrate absorption and blunt the exaggerated incretin response. Distal pancreatectomy is reserved for refractory cases. The diffuse localization on angiography and post-bypass context argue against focal insulinoma requiring enucleation.", "generator_model": "claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "seed": 127, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "target_topic": "Endocrine", "abms_specialty": "Endocrine", "abms_source": "topics_mapped", "source_label_raw": "endocrinology", "source_quiz_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed127", "source_question_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed127-004", "source_runs_root": "/home/dbernardo/Documents/pyres/MedEvalArena/eval_results/quizbench/quizzes_Jan2026/runs", "source_run_dir": "/home/dbernardo/Documents/pyres/MedEvalArena/eval_results/quizbench/quizzes_Jan2026/runs/claude-opus-4-5-20251101/20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed127", "source_quiz_path": "/home/dbernardo/Documents/pyres/MedEvalArena/quizzes/quizzes_Jan2026/20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed127.jsonl", "pred": "E", "model_outputs": "The answer is (E)"}]
