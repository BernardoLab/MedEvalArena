Add lamotrigine 25 mg daily\n- Lamotrigine is better for bipolar depression, not acute mania\n- Slow titration required\n- Not appropriate for acute manic episode\n\nBest Answer:\nThe most appropriate next step is to add a mood stabilizer that works in renal disease. Valproic acid is the best choice because:\n1. It's effective for acute mania\n2. It's safe in renal disease (hepatic metabolism)\n3. It can be started at therapeutic doses quickly\n4.

The adenosine resistance and procainamide response are consistent with an accessory pathway with rapid conduction properties.\n\nKey Consideration for Ablation vs Medical Management:\n\nThe critical factor determining whether to proceed with ablation in WPW is the risk of sudden cardiac death, particularly the ability of the accessory pathway to conduct rapidly during atrial fibrillation.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\nA. AP effective refractory period of 270 ms - This is relatively long, suggesting slower conduction. Less concerning for rapid AF conduction.\n\nB. Inducible orthodromic AVRT - This is common in WPW and doesn't necessarily indicate high risk for sudden death.\n\nC. Left lateral position - Location alone doesn't determine ablation necessity.\n\nD. Shortest pre-excited RR interval during induced AF of 220 ms - This is the KEY finding. An RR interval <250 ms during AF indicates rapid accessory pathway conduction and carries significant risk of degeneration to VF and sudden cardiac death. This is the strongest indication for ablation regardless of symptoms.\n\nE. Decremental conduction properties - This actually suggests SLOWER conduction, which is protective against rapid AF conduction.\n\nAnswer Rationale:\nOption D represents the most important electrophysiologic finding that mandates ablation. A shortest pre-excited RR interval of 220 ms indicates the accessory pathway can conduct very rapidly during atrial fibrillation, creating risk for sudden cardiac death. This finding alone is sufficient to recommend ablation even in asymptomatic patients.\n\nThe answer is (D)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p04-010", "question": "A 52-year-old man with type 2 diabetes presents for evaluation of recurrent hypoglycemia occurring 3-4 hours postprandially.
