These findings developed after the initiation of haloperidol, an antipsychotic medication known to block dopamine receptors.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\nA. Anticholinergic toxicity from haloperidol-donepezil interaction: While haloperidol has anticholinergic properties and donepezil is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, anticholinergic toxicity typically presents with symptoms like dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary retention, constipation, confusion, and delirium. Severe muscle rigidity and markedly elevated CK are not characteristic features of anticholinergic toxicity, especially to this degree.\n\nB. Dopamine receptor blockade causing neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS): Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome is a rare but serious side effect of antipsychotic medications (like haloperidol) that primarily block dopamine D2 receptors. The classic symptoms of NMS include hyperthermia, severe skeletal muscle rigidity, autonomic instability (diaphoresis, labile blood pressure, tachycardia), and altered mental status (confusion, delirium, stupor, coma). Marked elevations in CK due to rhabdomyolysis are also a hallmark of NMS. The patient's symptoms, including fever, severe rigidity, diaphoresis, altered consciousness, and extremely high CK level, are highly consistent with NMS. The presence of pneumonia may have acted as a precipitating factor for NMS.\n\nC. Serotonin syndrome from memantine-haloperidol interaction: Serotonin syndrome is caused by excessive serotonergic activity. While haloperidol has some serotonergic effects, its primary action related to NMS is dopamine blockade. Memantine is an NMDA receptor antagonist and does not primarily affect serotonin levels. Serotonin syndrome can cause fever, rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability, but often includes hyperreflexia and myoclonus, which are not specifically described here, and the rigidity is often less severe or different in character compared to NMS. Given haloperidol's mechanism and the patient's specific symptoms, NMS is a more likely diagnosis.\n\nD. Malignant hyperthermia triggered by infection: Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is primarily triggered by volatile anesthetic agents and succinylcholine, not by infection or antipsychotic medications. While it shares symptoms of hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, and rhabdomyolysis, the trigger is different.\n\nE. Central fever from hypothalamic involvement by infection: Central fever is a hypothalamic dysfunction causing fever, often unresponsive to antipyretics. While infection can cause central fever, the severe generalized muscle rigidity and extremely high CK levels are not typical primary manifestations of central fever alone. The temporal association with haloperidol initiation strongly suggests a drug-induced etiology.\n\nConclusion: The patient's presentation is most consistent with Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome, caused by dopamine receptor blockade from haloperidol.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p04-002", "question": "A 6-year-old boy presents with progressive gait instability, frequent falls, and difficulty climbing stairs over the past year.

He presents with progressive symptoms of muscle weakness. The key question is about disease-modifying therapy that is most likely to slow disease progression.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\nA. Deflazacort is a corticosteroid. Corticosteroids are the cornerstone of disease-modifying therapy in DMD. They have been shown to slow muscle degeneration, preserve muscle strength, and improve pulmonary and cardiac function, thereby delaying loss of ambulation and improving survival. The recommended dose for deflazacort in DMD is typically 0.9 mg/kg/day for daily administration. For a 22 kg child, this would be 0.9 * 22 = 19.8 mg/day, which falls within the expected dosing range.\n\nB. Eteplirsen is an exon-skipping antisense oligonucleotide that is FDA-approved for patients with DMD caused by a mutation amenable to skipping exon 51 of the dystrophin gene. This therapy is mutation-specific. The question states a \"deletion\" but does not specify if it's a deletion amenable to exon 51 skipping. Therefore, we cannot assume efficacy for this patient.\n\nC. Ataluren is a medication approved for patients with DMD caused by a nonsense mutation. It works by enabling the ribosome to read through the premature stop codon. The patient has a \"deletion,\" not a nonsense mutation, making ataluren inappropriate for him.\n\nD. Golodirsen is an exon-skipping antisense oligonucleotide that is FDA-approved for patients with DMD caused by a mutation amenable to skipping exon 53. Similar to eteplirsen, this therapy is mutation-specific, and the question does not provide information indicating suitability for this patient.\n\nE. Idebenone is a synthetic antioxidant that has shown some benefit in improving cardiac function in patients with DMD, particularly those with left ventricular dysfunction. The patient's echocardiogram shows normal left ventricular function, so the primary indication for idebenone is not present. Furthermore, its efficacy in slowing overall disease progression in muscle function is not as well-established as corticosteroids.\n\nConsidering the available information, deflazacort is the most universally applicable and established disease-modifying therapy for slowing the progression of Duchenne muscular dystrophy across all types of causative mutations, including deletions, when appropriate. The other options are mutation-specific or have a different primary indication.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p04-003", "question": "A 24-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after being rescued from a house fire.

However, 6 hours into resuscitation, despite receiving 14 liters of crystalloid, he remains hypotensive (BP 88/52 mmHg) and tachycardic (HR 132 bpm). Furthermore, he has profound oliguria (15 mL urine output over 2 hours).\n\nCrucially, the bladder pressure is measured at 32 mmHg. A bladder pressure of >20 mmHg is strongly suggestive of abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). In this patient, 32 mmHg is diagnostic of ACS. ACS is characterized by elevated intra-abdominal pressure leading to organ dysfunction, including impaired renal perfusion (causing oliguria), reduced venous return (contributing to hypotension and tachycardia), and potentially impaired diaphragmatic excursion (contributing to increased airway pressures). The rising peak airway pressures (from 28 to 48 cmH2O) are also concerning and can be exacerbated by increased intra-abdominal pressure pushing up on the diaphragm, reducing lung volumes.\n\nLet's evaluate the options in light of ACS:\nA. Increasing crystalloid infusion rate by 50% might worsen fluid overload if the underlying problem is impaired organ perfusion due to ACS, which is hindering effective fluid distribution and utilization.\nB. Adding albumin 5% is a later consideration in burn resuscitation and does not address the immediate, life-threatening issue of ACS.\nC. Bilateral chest escharotomies are indicated for circumferential chest burns that restrict breathing. While potential chest wall restriction can contribute to increased airway pressures, the prominent finding of markedly elevated bladder pressure points more strongly to ACS as the primary driver of the current decompensation.\nD. Decompressive laparotomy is the definitive treatment for abdominal compartment syndrome. Relieving the elevated intra-abdominal pressure is essential to restore organ perfusion, improve ventilation, and potentially reverse the shock state and oliguria.\nE.

This persistent or worsening microangiopathy, renal failure, and neurological symptoms necessitate consideration of other diagnoses or more aggressive management than standard supportive care for HELLP.\n\nThe ADAMTS13 activity level of 68% is crucial.

The transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) reveals critical findings: severe paravalvular regurgitation (PVL), a pericardial effusion of 1.8 cm, and right atrial collapse. Right atrial collapse in the context of a pericardial effusion is a classic sign of cardiac tamponade, a medical emergency where the accumulated fluid in the pericardial sac compresses the heart, impairing diastolic filling and reducing cardiac output. The severe hypotension is most likely a consequence of this combined issue, with severe PVL contributing to haemodynamic instability and tamponade being the acute, life-threatening mechanical compression.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\nA. Initiate cardiopulmonary bypass via femoral cannulation: This is a definitive treatment for severe hemodynamic instability. However, it is an invasive surgical procedure and might not be the *immediate* first step if a less invasive but equally effective intervention is available.\n\nB. Administer atropine 1 mg and epinephrine 100 mcg: Atropine is used to treat bradycardia. While the patient is bradycardic, the underlying cause of the profound hypotension is likely tamponade, not solely the heart rate. Epinephrine is a vasopressor/inotrope. While it might temporarily support blood pressure, it will not resolve the mechanical compression from tamponade. Vasopressors can even worsen filling if systemic vascular resistance increases without adequate stroke volume.\n\nC. Perform emergent pericardiocentesis via subxiphoid approach: This directly addresses the cardiac tamponade by draining the pericardial effusion, relieving the pressure on the heart. Given the significant effusion size (1.8 cm) and right atrial collapse, tamponade is highly suspected and is the most likely cause of the acute hemodynamic collapse requiring immediate action. Pericardiocentesis is a rapid procedure that can quickly restore hemodynamic stability.\n\nD. Deploy a second transcatheter valve within the first valve: This is a potential intervention for severe PVL. However, it does not address the tamponade. If tamponade is the primary driver of shock, attempting to fix PVL first might be futile or even dangerous as the heart is not adequately filled or functional.\n\nE. Initiate peripheral venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO): VA-ECMO is a form of mechanical circulatory support for profound shock. It is a rescue therapy. However, like CPB, it is invasive, and if a more direct and less invasive treatment for the underlying cause (tamponade) is available, that should be prioritized.

Administer 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) then IV alteplase and thrombectomy: PCC is used to rapidly reverse the effects of warfarin and vitamin K antagonists. Reversing the INR with PCC would make the patient eligible for IV alteplase. The combination of IV alteplase followed by mechanical thrombectomy is generally considered the most effective reperfusion strategy for LVO strokes when feasible and safe.

This approach aims to maximize the chance of good neurological outcome.\nE.

The post-conversion ECG clearly shows evidence of pre-excitation (short PR interval, delta waves, prolonged QRS). The primary indication for catheter ablation in patients with WPW is often to prevent sudden cardiac death (SCD) due to rapid conduction of atrial arrhythmias (like atrial fibrillation) down the accessory pathway, leading to extremely fast ventricular rates and potentially ventricular fibrillation.\n\nWe need to identify the electrophysiologic finding that most strongly supports proceeding with catheter ablation over medical management. Medical management for WPW primarily involves antiarrhythmic drugs, which can suppress arrhythmias but do not eliminate the underlying accessory pathway and carry risks of recurrence and lack of efficacy during rapid atrial tachyarrhythmias. Catheter ablation aims to eliminate the accessory pathway, thus preventing all associated arrhythmias and eliminating the risk of SCD.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\nA. Accessory pathway effective refractory period (ERP) of 270 ms: A longer accessory pathway ERP (e.g., >250 ms) suggests a lower likelihood of anterograde conduction to very high rates during atrial fibrillation. This is generally considered a lower-risk feature, making ablation less immediately critical compared to pathways with short ERPs.\nB. Inducible orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT): Orthodromic AVRT is the most common tachycardia associated with WPW and is often symptomatic. Induction of symptomatic AVRT is a reason to consider ablation; however, it can often be managed medically. The risk of SCD during orthodromic AVRT is very low because the accessory pathway conducts retrogradely, and the AV node limits the ventricular rate.\nC. Accessory pathway located in the left lateral position: While the presence of delta waves with a northwest axis and RBBB morphology on ECG suggests a left-sided accessory pathway, the precise location alone is not the *strongest* predictor for immediate ablation versus medical management compared to electrophysiologic properties that confer a high risk of SCD. Ablation success rates are generally high for left lateral pathways.\nD. Shortest pre-excited RR interval during induced atrial fibrillation of 220 ms: This is a critical measure of anterograde conduction capability of the accessory pathway. A shortest pre-excited RR interval (SPRR) of 220 ms indicates that during atrial fibrillation, the ventricular rate could reach approximately 273 beats per minute (60,000 ms / 220 ms ≈ 273 bpm). A SPRR of ≤ 250 ms is considered a marker of high risk for sudden cardiac death due to the potential for degeneration into ventricular fibrillation. Such a finding strongly supports proceeding with catheter ablation to eliminate this risk.\nE. Decremental conduction properties of the accessory pathway: Pathways exhibiting decremental conduction properties (i.e., conduction slows and eventually blocks as the rate of stimulation increases) are generally less likely to conduct extremely rapid ventricular rates. This is a lower-risk feature and would argue against immediate mandatory ablation in favor of medical management, provided the symptoms are otherwise manageable.\n\nComparing the options, the shortest pre-excited RR interval during induced atrial fibrillation of 220 ms (Option D) is the electrophysiologic finding that most strongly supports proceeding with catheter ablation rather than medical management, as it signifies a high risk of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p04-010", "question": "A 52-year-old man with type 2 diabetes presents for evaluation of recurrent hypoglycemia occurring 3-4 hours postprandially.
