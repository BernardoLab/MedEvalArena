Patient Diagnosis: The child has Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), confirmed by clinical features (Gowers' sign, pseudohypertrophy), elevated CK, and genetic testing showing a deletion in the dystrophin gene.\n\n2.  Goal of Therapy: The question asks for the treatment most likely to slow disease progression.\n\n3.  Evaluate Option A (Deflazacort): Corticosteroids (prednisone or deflazacort) are the current standard of care for all patients with DMD who have not yet lost ambulation (and often continued afterward). They effectively slow the decline in muscle strength and function, prolong independent ambulation by several years, preserve respiratory function, and delay the onset of cardiomyopathy. The recommended dose for deflazacort is 0.9 mg/kg/day. This treatment applies to all DMD patients regardless of the specific genotype.\n\n4.  Evaluate Option B (Eteplirsen): Eteplirsen is an exon-skipping therapy approved for patients with a confirmed mutation amenable to exon 51 skipping. While the patient has a deletion, the specific exons deleted are not specified in the vignette. Only about 13-14% of DMD patients have mutations amenable to exon 51 skipping. Without specific genetic details, this cannot be selected as the definitive treatment.\n\n5.  Evaluate Option C (Ataluren): Ataluren promotes ribosomal read-through of premature stop codons (nonsense mutations). The vignette states the patient has a *deletion* in the dystrophin gene, not a nonsense mutation. Therefore, Ataluren is not indicated.\n\n6.  Evaluate Option D (Golodirsen): Similar to Eteplirsen, Golodirsen is indicated for patients with mutations amenable to exon 53 skipping. Without specific mutation details, this is not the best answer.\n\n7.  Evaluate Option E (Idebenone): Idebenone is an antioxidant that has been studied for preserving respiratory function, primarily in non-ambulatory patients. It is not the first-line therapy for slowing general motor progression in a 6-year-old ambulatory child compared to corticosteroids.\n\n8.  Conclusion: Corticosteroids are the only universally applicable disease-modifying pharmacotherapy for DMD shown to prolong ambulation. Deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day is the correct drug and dosage.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p04-003", "question": "A 24-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after being rescued from a house fire.

Organ dysfunction:\n    *   Renal: Oliguria (15 mL/2 hrs) despite massive fluid resuscitation.\n    *   Pulmonary: Increased peak airway pressures (from 28 to 48 cmH2O) due to upward displacement of the diaphragm by abdominal pressure.\n    *   Cardiovascular: Hypotension (88/52 mmHg) and tachycardia, likely due to compression of the inferior vena cava reducing venous return.\n\nThe patient has received massive fluid resuscitation (14 L in 6 hours), which far exceeds the standard Parkland formula estimate (fluid creep), a known risk factor for developing ACS (secondary ACS), compounded by likely circumferential torso burns (primary ACS component).\n\nManagement:\nThe definitive treatment for ACS involves decompressive measures. In a patient with extensive full-thickness burns (65% TBSA) involving the trunk, the abdominal wall eschar allows no compliance, acting as a rigid shell. As visceral edema accumulates, pressure rises.\n*   A (Increase crystalloid): The patient is already fluid overloaded, and the hypotension/oliguria are mechanical in origin. More fluid will worsen the edema and pressure.\n*   B (Add albumin): While colloid can preserve volume with less fluid later in resuscitation, it does not treat the immediate life-threatening mechanical compression.\n*   C (Chest escharotomies): While the peak airway pressures are high, the constellation of oliguria, hypotension, and elevated bladder pressure points to the abdomen as the primary source of pathology. Relieving the abdomen will lower airway pressures by allowing the diaphragm to descend. Chest escharotomies alone would not resolve the oliguria or hypotension caused by IVC compression.\n*   D (Decompressive laparotomy): This is a definitive treatment for ACS but is associated with high morbidity (open abdomen). In patients with full-thickness abdominal burns, the restriction is often in the abdominal wall (eschar).\n*   E (Bedside abdominal escharotomy): This is the most appropriate next step. Clinical guidelines dictate that if a burn patient with ACS has eschar on the abdominal wall, a decompressive escharotomy should be performed first. It is a bedside procedure that releases the constricting eschar, often sufficiently lowering IAP to restore perfusion.

Current Status: He is on lithium, and the level is within the therapeutic range (0.6–1.2 mEq/L), though on the lower end for acute mania treatment. However, lithium titration is slow to take effect.\n3.  Renal Considerations: The patient has nephrotic syndrome.\n    *   Valproic acid (Option B): Valproate is highly protein-bound. In nephrotic syndrome, hypoalbuminemia leads to a significant increase in the free (active) fraction of the drug. Standard monitoring measures total valproate, which might appear normal or low while the free level is toxic. This makes valproate difficult and risky to manage in this setting.\n    *   Lithium (Option A): While increasing lithium is a valid strategy for mania, the onset of action is relatively slow (days to weeks for full effect). In a patient with severe symptoms and potential fluid/renal dynamic shifts, rapid stabilization is preferred. As the sole intervention, it may not be sufficient for steroid-induced agitation.\n4.  Steroid Management (Option D): While steroids are the precipitant, they are the primary treatment for the patient's active renal disease. Abruptly discontinuing prednisone can lead to adrenal crisis and relapse of nephrotic syndrome. Management typically involves treating the psychiatric symptoms concurrently, unless they are intractable, at which point a taper would be coordinated with nephrology. Immediate switch to cyclosporine is not the standard first-line psychiatric intervention.\n5.  Lamotrigine (Option E): Lamotrigine requires slow titration to avoid severe rash (Stevens-Johnson syndrome) and is not effective for acute mania.\n6.  Antipsychotics (Option C): Adding a second-generation antipsychotic like olanzapine is the most appropriate step. Olanzapine has a rapid onset of action, is highly effective for acute mania (including steroid-induced), and serves as an effective augmentation strategy for patients breaking through on mood stabilizers.
