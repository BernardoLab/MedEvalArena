The \"abnormal hemoglobin species\" likely represents methemoglobin or reflects the measurement artifact from cyanide interference. The cherry-red skin and inability to extract oxygen despite high PaO2 (tissues cannot use oxygen due to cytochrome c oxidase inhibition) are pathognomonic.\n\nWhy the other options are wrong:\n- A (Hyperbaric O2): Used for CO poisoning, but carboxyhemoglobin is only 8% (not the primary problem)\n- C (Methylene blue): Used for methemoglobinemia, not cyanide\n- D (Exchange transfusion): Not indicated here\n- E (Sodium thiosulfate): Used as adjunctive therapy with hydroxocobalamin, but hydroxocobalamin is the primary agent\n\nWhy B is correct:\nHydroxocobalamin is the first-line antidote for cyanide poisoning.

Fibrinous exudate suggests contained leak/early abscess formation\n5. No contrast extravasation suggests the leak is small/contained\n\nAnalysis of Options:\n\nA. Washout with drain placement - Insufficient for symptomatic peritonitis with free air and significant fluid collection. Too conservative.\n\nB. Takedown with end ileostomy and mucous fistula - Creates two stomas, more morbid than necessary.\n\nC. Takedown with end ileostomy and Hartmann's pouch - Standard approach for anastomotic leak with peritonitis. Diverts fecal stream, allows healing, and can be reversed later.\n\nD. Resection with re-anastomosis and diverting loop ileostomy - Risky to create another anastomosis in the setting of active peritonitis and compromised tissue.\n\nE. Omental patch reinforcement - Doesn't address the leak adequately; anastomosis is already compromised.\n\nBest Answer:\nGiven the symptomatic anastomotic leak with peritonitis, free air, and significant fluid collection, the safest approach is to take down the anastomosis and create a diversion. A Hartmann's pouch (distal bowel closure) with end ileostomy is the standard of care for this scenario, allowing the patient to recover from peritonitis and enabling reversal later.\n\nThe answer is C"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p01-007", "question": "A 58-year-old man with type 2 diabetes presents with sudden painless vision loss in his right eye upon awakening.
