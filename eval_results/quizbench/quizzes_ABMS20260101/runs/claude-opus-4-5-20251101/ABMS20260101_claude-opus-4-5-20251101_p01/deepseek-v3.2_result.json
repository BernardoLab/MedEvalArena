Presence of bile duct remnants <150 µm at porta hepatis** – This is a key histological predictor. In biliary atresia, the size of microscopic bile duct remnants in the portal plate correlates with surgical success; smaller duct size (<150–200 µm) is associated with poor bile flow after Kasai.  \n- **B. Bridging fibrosis without cirrhosis** – Significant fibrosis at diagnosis is a poor prognostic factor, but it is not the single strongest intraoperative finding among the options given.  \n- **C. CMV IgM positivity** – Associated with worse prognosis in some studies, but not the strongest anatomical/histological predictor at surgery.  \n- **D. Splenic malformation syndrome with polysplenia** – Part of biliary atresia splenic malformation (BASM) syndrome, which has a worse prognosis, but polysplenia itself is not as directly predictive of failed drainage as duct size.  \n- **E. Absence of common bile duct with patent proximal hepatic ducts** – This describes an anatomical type of biliary atresia (type III, most common), but not the strongest predictor of failure; some type III cases still drain well if duct remnants are adequate.  \n\nEvidence from surgical outcome studies indicates that **microscopic bile duct diameter at the transected porta hepatis <150–200 µm** is a strong independent predictor of poor bile drainage post-Kasai and early transplant need.
