Larger ductules (>150 micrometers) at the transection site correlate with better bile drainage. Ductules <150 micrometers are associated with poor outcomes as they indicate inadequate biliary channels for drainage.\n\nOption B: Bridging fibrosis on liver biopsy without established cirrhosis\nWhile fibrosis is concerning, bridging fibrosis without cirrhosis still allows for potential recovery if bile flow is established. This is not the strongest predictor of failure.\n\nOption C: Cytomegalovirus IgM positivity in the infant\nCMV-associated biliary atresia has been studied, and while it may influence outcomes, it's not the strongest surgical predictor of failure.\n\nOption D: Splenic malformation syndrome with polysplenia\nBiliary atresia splenic malformation (BASM) syndrome is associated with worse outcomes. However, the anatomical findings at surgery are more directly predictive.\n\nOption E: Absence of the common bile duct with patent proximal hepatic ducts\nIf proximal hepatic ducts are patent, this would actually suggest a better prognosis as there are identifiable bile ducts that could potentially drain.\n\nThe key prognostic factor at surgery is the microscopic anatomy of the bile duct remnants at the porta hepatis.

Is there an anastomotic leak? The CT shows no contrast extravasation, and the anastomosis appears intact at exploration. However, there is free air, fluid collection near the anastomosis, and peritonitis with polymicrobial organisms - this suggests a contained or sealed leak, or at minimum, significant anastomotic compromise.\n\n2. Patient condition: The patient is septic with elevated lactate (3.2 mmol/L), indicating tissue hypoperfusion. This is a sick patient.\n\n3. Anastomotic integrity: While appearing \"intact,\" the edema, fibrinous exudate, and surrounding contamination suggest the anastomosis is at high risk for failure or has already had a subclinical leak.\n\nSurgical Options Analysis:\n\n- Option A (Washout + drain, preserve anastomosis): Risky in a septic patient with clear signs of anastomotic-related complication. The anastomosis may fail.\n\n- Option B (End ileostomy + mucous fistula): This is the safest option - complete fecal diversion, removes the at-risk anastomosis, and creates a mucous fistula from the colon.\n\n- Option C (End ileostomy + Hartmann's pouch): This would be appropriate for left-sided surgery. After right hemicolectomy, the remaining colon is transverse/descending colon - a mucous fistula is more appropriate than a Hartmann's pouch.\n\n- Option D (Re-anastomosis with diverting ileostomy): Creating a new anastomosis in a septic, contaminated field is contraindicated.\n\n- Option E (Omental patch): Insufficient for a septic patient with peritonitis.\n\nBest Answer: In a septic patient with peritonitis and a compromised anastomosis, the safest approach is to take down the anastomosis and create an end ileostomy. Given this is a right-sided procedure, a mucous fistula (bringing up the remaining colon) is preferred over a Hartmann's pouch.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p01-007", "question": "A 58-year-old man with type 2 diabetes presents with sudden painless vision loss in his right eye upon awakening.

Anterior chamber paracentesis - This is a traditional treatment aimed at lowering IOP to improve perfusion pressure. However, evidence supporting its efficacy is weak, and it has not been shown to significantly improve outcomes in controlled studies.\n\nB. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) - The EAGLE study and other trials have not shown clear benefit for IV thrombolysis specifically for CRAO. While some case series suggest potential benefit, the evidence is not strong.\n\nC. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy - Some studies suggest potential benefit if administered early (within 8-12 hours), as it can provide oxygen to the retina via choroidal circulation. However, evidence remains limited and it's not widely available.\n\nD. Intra-arterial thrombolysis - The EAGLE study (European Assessment Group for Lysis in the Eye) was stopped early due to lack of efficacy and increased adverse events. This intervention does not have strong evidence supporting its use.\n\nE. Conservative management with secondary stroke prevention - Given that CRAO is essentially a \"stroke of the eye\" and carries significant risk of subsequent cerebrovascular events, secondary prevention is crucial. Unfortunately, no intervention has been proven to reliably restore vision in CRAO. The retina suffers irreversible damage within 90-240 minutes of complete ischemia. Most studies have failed to show significant benefit from acute interventions.\n\nGiven the lack of strong evidence for any acute intervention improving visual outcomes, and the importance of treating CRAO as a stroke equivalent requiring secondary prevention measures, conservative management with secondary stroke prevention has the most evidence-based support for overall patient care, even if not specifically for visual recovery.\n\nHowever, the question asks about \"visual recovery\" specifically. The honest answer is that no intervention has strong evidence for visual recovery.
