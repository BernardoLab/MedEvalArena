Tonsillectomy (with or without adenoidectomy) achieves complete resolution in 63-95% of patients and is considered curative. Colchicine and cimetidine have variable efficacy for prophylaxis. Anakinra is reserved for refractory cases. The classic presentation with negative genetic testing and stereotypical episodes strongly supports PFAPA, where tonsillectomy offers the best chance of definitive cure.", "generator_model": "claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "seed": 126, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "target_topic": "Pediatrics", "abms_specialty": "Pediatrics", "abms_source": "topics_mapped", "source_label_raw": "Pediatrics", "source_quiz_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed126", "source_question_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed126-005", "source_runs_root": "/home/dbernardo/Documents/pyres/MedEvalArena/eval_results/quizbench/quizzes_Jan2026/runs", "source_run_dir": "/home/dbernardo/Documents/pyres/MedEvalArena/eval_results/quizbench/quizzes_Jan2026/runs/claude-opus-4-5-20251101/20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed126", "source_quiz_path": "/home/dbernardo/Documents/pyres/MedEvalArena/quizzes/quizzes_Jan2026/20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed126.jsonl", "pred": "D", "model_outputs": "The answer is (D)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p05", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p05-010", "question": "A 6-year-old boy presents with recurrent episodes of weakness and dark urine following viral illnesses. Laboratory studies during an acute episode show: serum creatine kinase 45,000 U/L, myoglobinuria, and non-ketotic hypoglycemia with inappropriately low free fatty acids.

Management requires restriction of long-chain fatty acids (which cannot be metabolized) and supplementation with medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), which bypass the defective enzyme and provide an alternative energy source. MCT avoidance would be harmful. Carnitine supplementation alone without dietary modification is insufficient, and high-protein diets do not address the underlying metabolic defect.", "generator_model": "claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "seed": 127, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "target_topic": "Pediatrics", "abms_specialty": "Pediatrics", "abms_source": "topics_mapped", "source_label_raw": "Pediatrics", "source_quiz_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed127", "source_question_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed127-002", "source_runs_root": "/home/dbernardo/Documents/pyres/MedEvalArena/eval_results/quizbench/quizzes_Jan2026/runs", "source_run_dir": "/home/dbernardo/Documents/pyres/MedEvalArena/eval_results/quizbench/quizzes_Jan2026/runs/claude-opus-4-5-20251101/20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed127", "source_quiz_path": "/home/dbernardo/Documents/pyres/MedEvalArena/quizzes/quizzes_Jan2026/20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed127.jsonl", "pred": "C", "model_outputs": "The answer is (C)"}]
