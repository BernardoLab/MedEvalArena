However, he is:\n- Alert and cooperative\n- Tolerating the mask\n- Not in immediate respiratory arrest\n\nAnalyzing options:\n\nA. Increase IPAP to 18 cm H2O: The pressure support (IPAP-EPAP) is currently only 7 cm H2O, which is relatively low. Increasing IPAP increases tidal volume and minute ventilation, which directly addresses hypercapnia. This is a reasonable escalation before intubation.\n\nB. Intubation: While the patient is worsening, he is still alert, cooperative, and tolerating NIV. Intubation carries significant risks in COPD patients. Guidelines suggest optimizing NIV settings before proceeding to intubation if the patient is tolerating NIV.\n\nC. Heliox: This can reduce airway resistance but is not first-line and evidence is limited.\n\nD. High-flow nasal cannula: HFNC is less effective than BiPAP for hypercapnic respiratory failure. This would be a step backward.\n\nE. Increase EPAP to 10: Increasing EPAP primarily helps with oxygenation and auto-PEEP, but the main problem here is hypercapnia. This wouldn't significantly improve CO2 clearance.\n\nDecision: The current IPAP of 12 is relatively low. Standard practice is to titrate IPAP up (often to 16-20 cm H2O) to improve ventilation before considering intubation, especially in a patient who is tolerating the mask and remains alert. The worsening ABG after only 2 hours with suboptimal settings warrants optimization of NIV first.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p05", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p05-003", "question": "A 45-year-old woman from rural Peru presents with a 3-month history of progressive dysphagia, regurgitation, and 20-pound weight loss.

The acute phase involves parasitemia, but chronic manifestations occur years later when parasites are scarce.\n\nB. Autoimmune destruction of intramural neurons and cardiac myocytes - This is the leading theory for chronic Chagas disease pathophysiology. During acute infection, the immune response to T. cruzi leads to molecular mimicry and autoantibodies that cross-react with host tissues. This causes destruction of:\n- Myenteric (Auerbach's) plexus neurons in the esophagus → loss of peristalsis and LES dysfunction\n- Cardiac myocytes and conduction system → dilated cardiomyopathy with characteristic apical aneurysm\n\nC. Eosinophilic infiltration - This is more characteristic of eosinophilic esophagitis or parasitic infections like Strongyloides, not Chagas disease.\n\nD.

Toxin-mediated damage similar to diphtheria - Diphtheria toxin causes myocarditis through direct toxin effects.
