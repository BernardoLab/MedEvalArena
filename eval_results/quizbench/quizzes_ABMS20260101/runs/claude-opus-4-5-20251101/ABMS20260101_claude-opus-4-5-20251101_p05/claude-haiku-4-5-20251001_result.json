Aberrant lymphocytes: CD3-, CD7+, CD103+, CD8-, with monoclonal TCR rearrangement\n\nDiagnosis:\nThis is Refractory Celiac Disease Type II (RCD-II), characterized by:\n- Intraepithelial lymphocytes with aberrant phenotype (loss of surface CD3, abnormal CD8 expression)\n- Monoclonal T-cell population\n- High risk of progression to enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL)\n\nTreatment Approach for RCD-II:\n\nRCD-II is an aggressive condition with poor prognosis if untreated. The standard treatment hierarchy is:\n\n1. First-line: Corticosteroids (budesonide preferred for topical effect)\n2. Second-line: Cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine) - a purine analog that is particularly effective for T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders\n3.

Cladribine-based chemotherapy - Second-line agent specifically for RCD-II; highly effective for T-cell malignancies; appropriate when steroids fail or for aggressive disease\n- C. Infliximab - TNF inhibitor; not standard for RCD-II\n- D. Azathioprine - Steroid-sparing agent; not primary therapy for RCD-II\n- E. Mesalamine - For inflammatory bowel disease; not indicated for RCD-II\n\nGiven the monoclonal T-cell population and aggressive nature of RCD-II, cladribine is the most appropriate choice as it targets the aberrant T-cell clone and offers the best chance of remission before considering ASCT.\n\nThe answer is B"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p05", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p05-002", "question": "A 71-year-old man with COPD GOLD stage III is hospitalized for acute exacerbation.

Increase IPAP to 18 cm H2O - This addresses the inadequate ventilation. Higher IPAP increases minute ventilation and CO2 elimination. Since the patient is worsening on current settings and is tolerating the mask well, escalating NIV pressure is appropriate before considering intubation.\n\nB. Intubation - Premature. Patient is alert, cooperative, tolerating mask. NIV settings haven't been optimized yet. Intubation carries significant risks in elderly COPD patients.\n\nC. Heliox - Not standard for BiPAP in COPD exacerbation. Heliox is used in upper airway obstruction or severe asthma, not typically for hypercapnic respiratory failure.\n\nD. High-flow nasal cannula - Would be a step backward. Patient needs positive pressure ventilation for CO2 elimination, not just high-flow oxygen.\n\nE. Increase EPAP to 10 - EPAP is for oxygenation and preventing collapse. The problem here is hypercapnia (CO2 retention), not oxygenation. Increasing EPAP without increasing IPAP won't help CO2 elimination and may worsen air trapping in COPD.\n\nConclusion:\nThe patient is failing on current BiPAP settings with worsening hypercapnia. Since he's alert, cooperative, and tolerating the mask, the appropriate next step is to optimize NIV by increasing IPAP (which drives minute ventilation and CO2 elimination) before considering intubation.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p05", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_p05-003", "question": "A 45-year-old woman from rural Peru presents with a 3-month history of progressive dysphagia, regurgitation, and 20-pound weight loss.
