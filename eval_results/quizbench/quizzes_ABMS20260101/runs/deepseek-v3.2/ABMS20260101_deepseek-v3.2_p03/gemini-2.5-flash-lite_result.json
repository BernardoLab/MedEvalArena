The proposed mechanisms include calcium deposition in pancreatic ducts, increased secretion of pancreatic enzymes, and activation of trypsinogen within the pancreas. The patient's history of recurrent calcium oxalate kidney stones is also a common association with primary hyperparathyroidism, as excessive calcium in the urine increases the risk of stone formation.

This indicates a high-risk bleeding lesion, likely involving a vessel such as the gastroduodenal artery. The subsequent development of fever, severe abdominal pain, and CT findings of retroperitoneal air and fluid strongly suggest a perforation of the duodenum.\n\nWe must evaluate the options in the context of both persistent bleeding and perforation in a patient with alcohol-related cirrhosis.\n\nA. Angiographic embolization of the gastroduodenal artery: This is a highly effective intervention for ongoing arterial upper GI bleeding that has failed endoscopic therapy. It is less invasive than surgery and can stabilize the patient by controlling hemorrhage. While it does not directly address the perforation, controlling life-threatening bleeding is often the immediate priority, especially in a patient with cirrhosis where surgery carries high risk. If bleeding is controlled, further management of the perforation can be planned.\n\nB. Emergency laparotomy with duodenal diversion: This is a definitive treatment for a perforated duodenal ulcer. It allows for direct repair of the perforation and can also control any associated bleeding. However, major surgery, such as laparotomy, carries significant risks in patients with advanced cirrhosis, including coagulopathy, impaired healing, and increased operative mortality. While perforation is a serious complication, surgery might be considered a later step if less invasive measures fail or if the patient is hemodynamically unstable from sepsis rather than hemorrhage.\n\nC. Percutaneous drainage of the retroperitoneal collection: This addresses the consequence of a leak (the collection of fluid and air) but does not treat the source of the problem, which is the perforation. It is typically an adjunctive measure for managing contained abscesses, not the primary treatment for an active perforation with retroperitoneal tracking.\n\nD. Repeat endoscopy with over-the-scope clip placement: While repeat endoscopy might be considered for ongoing bleeding, the demonstration of retroperitoneal air on CT indicates a perforation, which typically cannot be definitively managed by endoscopy alone. Over-the-scope clips are advanced devices but are unlikely to reliably seal a perforated duodenal wall with associated retroperitoneal contamination.\n\nE. IV antibiotics and serial abdominal exams: IV antibiotics are crucial for managing suspected or confirmed infection/contamination associated with perforation, but they are not curative for the perforation itself. Serial abdominal exams are for monitoring, but the CT findings indicate an acute surgical problem requiring definitive intervention.\n\nConsidering the scenario: active arterial bleeding that is continuing despite endoscopic attempts, and evidence of duodenal perforation with retroperitoneal contamination. In a patient with cirrhosis, the risks of surgery are high. Therefore, the least invasive yet effective intervention for the immediate life threat should be prioritized. Ongoing arterial hemorrhage is a direct and immediate threat to life. Angiographic embolization is the standard next step for intractable arterial upper GI bleeding after failed endoscopy.

The history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is crucial, as SLE can be associated with various pulmonary manifestations, including interstitial pneumonitis.\n\nThe bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) shows a lymphocytic predominance (65%) with a CD4:CD8 ratio of 0.8. Lymphocytic alveolitis is a common feature of lupus pneumonitis. While the CD4:CD8 ratio of 0.8 is not as high as typically seen in sarcoidosis, it still indicates a significant lymphocytosis in the alveoli, which is consistent with an inflammatory process like lupus pneumonitis.\n\nThe HRCT findings of diffuse ground-glass opacities with superimposed fine reticulation and subpleural sparing are concerning for ILD. While this pattern is not pathognomonic for one specific type of ILD, it is compatible with various inflammatory interstitial processes, including lupus pneumonitis. The subpleural sparing is an atypical finding, but lupus-related lung disease can present with varied patterns.\n\nThe severely reduced DLCO (38%) indicates significant impairment of gas exchange, which warrants prompt and aggressive management.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. Initiate high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day: This represents aggressive immunosuppressive therapy. Given the high suspicion for active lupus pneumonitis, this is a standard and appropriate first-line treatment to control inflammation and improve lung function.\nB. Add mycophenolate mofetil to current immunosuppression: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is an effective immunosuppressant for various autoimmune conditions, including SLE-related ILD. However, high-dose corticosteroids are generally initiated first for acute flares of lupus pneumonitis. MMF might be considered as an add-on therapy or for steroid-sparing purposes if the patient does not respond adequately to steroids or to manage chronic disease.\nC. Discontinue hydroxychloroquine and observe for 4 weeks: Hydroxychloroquine-induced pulmonary toxicity is rare, and it is unlikely to be the cause of this patient's acute, progressive symptoms. Discontinuing treatment and observing without intervention would be inappropriate given the severity of symptoms and PFT abnormalities.\nD. Perform surgical lung biopsy to confirm usual interstitial pneumonia pattern: A surgical lung biopsy is an invasive procedure. While it can be diagnostic for ILD, it carries significant risks. The HRCT findings are not definitively characteristic of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) (which typically shows basal and peripheral predominance, often with honeycombing), and the BAL findings of lymphocytic predominance are not typical for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)/UIP. Empirical treatment for highly suspected lupus pneumonitis is often initiated without biopsy, especially in the context of active lupus.\nE. Start rituximab therapy without additional testing: Rituximab is a B-cell depleting agent used in more refractory cases of SLE or specific manifestations. It is typically a second-line or third-line therapy and would not be the initial step for suspected lupus pneumonitis.\n\nConsidering the clinical presentation, laboratory, and imaging findings, active lupus pneumonitis is the most likely diagnosis.

The goal is to preserve renal function.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. Selective arterial embolization of the dominant tumors: Embolization is primarily used to treat symptomatic AMLs, particularly to prevent or manage hemorrhage, or for very large tumors causing obstruction. While it can reduce the size of individual tumors, it does not address the diffuse nature of the disease (\"innumerable angiomyolipomas\") and is unlikely to preserve overall renal function in the setting of rapid decline.\n\nB. Initiation of everolimus therapy: Tuberous sclerosis complex is characterized by hyperactivation of the mTOR pathway. Everolimus is an mTOR inhibitor that has demonstrated efficacy in reducing the size of TSC-associated tumors, including renal AMLs, and slowing their growth. By controlling tumor proliferation and size, everolimus can help preserve renal tissue and function. Clinical trials have shown its benefit in TSC patients with renal AMLs. This is a systemic approach targeting the underlying pathology, aiming for preservation of function.\n\nC. Bilateral nephrectomy with dialysis initiation: This is a definitive treatment for end-stage renal disease, implying the complete loss of native renal function. The question asks for an intervention *to preserve* renal function, not to replace it when it's already lost. Bilateral nephrectomy would only be considered if renal function has reached end-stage and conservative measures have failed, or if there's an imminent life-threatening complication that cannot be managed otherwise.\n\nD. Cryoablation of the largest angiomyolipomas: Similar to embolization, cryoablation is a focal therapy for individual AMLs. It is not a suitable strategy for managing innumerable AMLs causing diffuse renal compromise and rapidly progressive insufficiency. It does not address the systemic nature of TSC and the widespread tumor burden.\n\nE. Radical nephrectomy of the more affected kidney: This is a unilateral surgical intervention. Given that both kidneys have \"massively enlarged\" and are filled with \"innumerable angiomyolipomas,\" removing only one kidney is unlikely to halt the progression of renal insufficiency affecting the remaining kidney. It does not provide a comprehensive solution for diffuse bilateral disease.\n\nConsidering the pathophysiology of TSC and the presentation of rapidly progressive renal insufficiency due to widespread AMLs, a systemic therapy like everolimus is the most appropriate intervention to attempt to slow disease progression and preserve remaining renal function.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p03", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p03-005", "question": "A 62-year-old man with essential thrombocythemia (JAK2 V617F-positive) on hydroxyurea presents with acute onset of severe headache and right hemiparesis.

Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) from hypercoagulable state: NBTE can occur in hypercoagulable states and lead to embolic strokes. However, the transthoracic echocardiogram showed no vegetations, making this diagnosis less likely, although not impossible if vegetations were small or on less accessible valves. Multiple enhancing lesions are not typical of bland emboli from NBTE.\n\nB.  Leukoencephalopathy from hydroxyurea toxicity: Hydroxyurea can cause neurotoxicity, including leukoencephalopathy, characterized by white matter changes that can enhance on MRI. However, leukoencephalopathy typically presents with more diffuse neurological symptoms and is less common as a direct cause of an isolated, acute MCA territory infarction.\n\nC.  Transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with CNS involvement: Patients with ET have an increased risk of transforming to AML. CNS involvement by leukemia can manifest as enhancing lesions on MRI. Leukemia can also cause stroke through hyperviscosity, hypocoagulability, or leukemic infiltration of blood vessels. While possible, there is no direct evidence (e.g., peripheral blast count, bone marrow biopsy) presented for AML transformation. It is a potential complication but not the most likely direct mechanism for these specific findings without further data.\n\nD.  Cerebral vasculitis secondary to JAK2 mutation: MPNs, including ET associated with JAK2 mutations, can be accompanied by systemic inflammation. Cerebral vasculitis is a rare but recognized complication of MPNs. Vasculitis can lead to narrowing or occlusion of cerebral arteries, causing ischemic stroke. The inflammatory process in the vessel walls or surrounding tissue can also manifest as enhancing lesions on MRI. This option provides a unified explanation for both the ischemic infarction and the multiple enhancing lesions, directly linking them to the underlying genetic mutation and disease state.\n\nE.  Paradoxical embolism through patent foramen ovale (PFO): A PFO allows for a right-to-left shunt, enabling emboli from the venous system or right heart to reach the arterial circulation. ET patients are prone to thrombosis. A PFO would explain an ischemic stroke. However, a paradoxical embolus typically causes one or more infarcts in a specific arterial territory; it is less likely to directly result in diffuse multiple small enhancing lesions across both cerebral hemispheres, which suggest a more widespread inflammatory, infiltrative, or demyelinating process.\n\nConsidering the combination of an ischemic stroke and multiple enhancing lesions in a patient with ET and JAK2 mutation, cerebral vasculitis (Option D) offers the most compelling explanation that integrates all the findings.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p03", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p03-006", "question": "A 28-year-old woman develops recurrent sinopulmonary infections and bronchiectasis.

The laboratory findings include absent IgA, markedly reduced IgG and IgM, and importantly, absent B cells on flow cytometry. This profound absence of B cells suggests a severe block in B cell development at a very early stage. The genetic testing reveals a mutation in the λ5 surrogate light chain gene.\n\nThe λ5 protein, along with Vpre-B, forms the surrogate light chain. This surrogate light chain pairs with a successfully rearranged μ heavy chain to form the pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) complex, which is expressed on the surface of pre-B cells. The pre-BCR plays a critical role in B cell development by:\n1.  Signaling for the survival and proliferation of pre-B cells.\n2.  Inhibiting further immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement (allelic exclusion).\n3.  Promoting the transition to the immature B cell stage by signaling for light chain rearrangement.\n\nA mutation in the λ5 gene means that a functional surrogate light chain cannot be formed. Consequently, a complete pre-BCR complex cannot assemble. The absence of the pre-BCR and its essential signaling pathways leads to apoptosis of pre-B cells, causing a developmental block at this stage. This results in a severe deficiency or absence of mature B cells, which explains the patient's agammaglobulinemia and susceptibility to infections.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. Failure of heavy chain rearrangement in pre-B cells: Heavy chain rearrangement occurs in pro-B cells, not pre-B cells. If heavy chain rearrangement fails in pro-B cells, they do not develop into pre-B cells capable of expressing a pre-BCR. While this would lead to absent B cells, the primary defect identified is in λ5, which is downstream of heavy chain rearrangement. The mutation prevents the *functioning* of the pre-BCR even if heavy chain rearrangement was successful.\n\nB. Defective VDJ recombination due to RAG deficiency: RAG proteins are essential for VDJ recombination. RAG deficiency causes a block in lymphocyte development (both T and B cells) at an earlier stage than described here, typically around the pro-T or pro-B cell stage, before heavy chain rearrangement. The specific mutation is in λ5, not RAG.\n\nC. Absence of the pre-B cell receptor complex signaling: This is the direct consequence of a λ5 mutation. Without functional λ5, the pre-BCR cannot form, leading to the absence of its crucial signaling for survival and proliferation. This perfectly explains the absent B cells and subsequent agammaglobulinemia.\n\nD.

Defects typically cause a block at a later stage of B cell maturation, often affecting mature B cell populations. The mutation identified is in λ5, not BLNK.\n\nE. Loss of BTK enzyme function disrupting B cell maturation: BTK is a critical kinase downstream of the pre-BCR and BCR. Loss of BTK function (as in XLA) also causes a block at the pre-B cell stage, leading to absent B cells. However, the specific genetic defect found is in λ5, not BTK.\n\nThe mutation in the λ5 surrogate light chain gene directly leads to the absence of the pre-B cell receptor complex and its signaling, which is the immunological abnormality explaining the absent B cells and the resulting sinopulmonary pathology.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p03", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p03-007", "question": "A 44-year-old woman presents with 8 months of progressive proximal muscle weakness, heliotrope rash, and Gottron's papules.

Biopsy shows lobulated granulomatous inflammation with rare 5-7 μm budding yeast. Culture confirms a dimorphic fungus that grows yeast at 37°C. The geographical location (Bolivia) strongly suggests an endemic mycosis. The key findings are granulomatous inflammation and a dimorphic yeast, indicating an infection caused by a fungus that exists as a mold at environmental temperatures and as a yeast in mammalian tissues.\n\nLet's evaluate potential pathogens and treatments:\n1.  Paracoccidioidomycosis: Caused by *Paracoccidioides brasiliensis*, endemic in South America. It typically causes chronic granulomatous disease. The yeast form is characteristically large (10-30 µm) and exhibits multiple budding (\"mariner's wheel\" appearance), which differs from the described 5-7 µm budding yeast, but atypical morphology can occur.\n2.  Histoplasmosis: Caused by *Histoplasma capsulatum*, found in North, Central, and South America. It causes granulomatous inflammation. The yeast form is typically small (2-5 µm) and often found intracellularly within macrophages, but extracellular budding yeast can be observed. The size range of 5-7 µm is at the upper end for *Histoplasma* yeast and larger than typical, but not completely exclusionary.\n3.  Sporotrichosis: Caused by *Sporothrix schenckii*, found worldwide, including South America. It typically presents as lymphocutaneous disease, but cutaneous forms can occur. The yeast form is 2-6 µm and buds. The yeast size fits better than for *Paracoccidioides* or *Histoplasma*, but the typical presentation is different.\n\nThe options for antifungal therapy are:\n*   A. Itraconazole for 6-12 months: Itraconazole is a broad-spectrum triazole and is the first-line oral treatment for mild to moderate histoplasmosis and paracoccidioidomycosis. A duration of 6-12 months is standard for disseminated histoplasmosis and paracoccidioidomycosis.\n*   B. Amphotericin B lipid complex followed by itraconazole: Amphotericin B is typically used for severe or life-threatening fungal infections. This regimen is appropriate for patients with severe disseminated disease.\n*   C. Voriconazole indefinitely: Voriconazole is primarily used for molds like *Aspergillus* and certain Candida species. It is not the standard first-line treatment for endemic dimorphic mycoses. Indefinite treatment is unusual unless for prophylaxis.\n*   D. Posaconazole with therapeutic drug monitoring: Posaconazole is effective for many endemic mycoses and can be used as step-down therapy or in specific situations. However, itraconazole is often preferred as initial oral therapy for moderate disease.\n*   E. Fluconazole for 3-6 months: Fluconazole can be used for histoplasmosis, particularly milder forms, but itraconazole generally has better efficacy against *Paracoccidioides* and many *Histoplasma* infections, especially when disseminated.\n\nGiven the presentation of a scalp lesion, granulomatous inflammation, and travel to Bolivia, histoplasmosis or paracoccidioidomycosis are strong possibilities. Itraconazole for 6-12 months is a standard and appropriate treatment for moderate disseminated forms of both these infections. While the yeast size of 5-7 µm may not perfectly align with the classic descriptions of *Histoplasma* (2-5 µm) or *Paracoccidioides* (10-30 µm), itraconazole remains the most appropriate choice among the given options for chronic endemic mycoses of this region. If the infection were severe, option B would be more likely, but the question doesn't specify severity. Option A represents a standard duration of therapy for moderate disseminated disease caused by these fungi.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p03", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p03-009", "question": "A 45‑year‑old woman with metastatic HER2‑positive breast cancer (bone, liver) on first‑line therapy with trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and docetaxel achieves a partial response after 6 cycles.

Continue trastuzumab/pertuzumab and add capecitabine: This is a reasonable treatment for progression in HER2+ disease, combining HER2-targeted therapy with chemotherapy. However, given the availability of more advanced HER2-directed therapies, it might not be the *single best* option.\n\nB. Switch to trastuzumab deruxtecan (T‑DXd): T-DXd is a highly potent antibody-drug conjugate targeting HER2. It has demonstrated significant efficacy in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have progressed on prior HER2-targeted therapies, including trastuzumab and pertuzumab. While NGS did not show HER2 amplification, the IHC of 3+ indicates the presence of HER2 protein, which is sufficient for T-DXd to be effective. T-DXd represents a significant step up in efficacy for patients who have progressed on earlier HER2-targeted regimens.\n\nC. Switch to lapatinib plus capecitabine: Lapatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of HER2 and EGFR, and this combination is effective in HER2+ disease. However, T-DXd has generally shown superior efficacy in later lines of therapy compared to lapatinib-based regimens.\n\nD. Switch to everolimus plus exemestane: Everolimus is an mTOR inhibitor, and exemestane is an aromatase inhibitor. This combination is indicated for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. Since this patient's tumor is ER/PR negative, this option is inappropriate.\n\nE. Switch to alpelisib plus fulvestrant: Alpelisib targets the PIK3CA pathway, and fulvestrant is an estrogen receptor degrader. This combination is FDA-approved for postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative, PIK3CA-mutated, advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Since this patient's tumor is ER/PR negative, this option is inappropriate.\n\nConsidering the progression on standard HER2-targeted therapy (trastuzumab/pertuzumab), the most appropriate next step is to switch to a more potent HER2-directed therapy. Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) has demonstrated superior clinical benefit in this setting and is the current standard of care for patients who have progressed on trastuzumab-based regimens. The PIK3CA mutation, while a significant finding, does not have a directly targetable therapy in this ER/PR-negative, HER2-positive context among the given options.

This is a known, albeit uncommon, adverse reaction to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). The goal is to prevent recurrence while ensuring adequate immune protection for her CVID.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\nA. Switch to subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG) at the same monthly dose: SCIG involves administering smaller doses of immunoglobulin more frequently (e.g., weekly or bi-weekly) subcutaneously. This leads to more stable serum IgG levels and avoids the large bolus infusion that appears to be triggering the aseptic meningitis in this patient. It is a highly effective strategy for patients experiencing recurrent or severe infusion-related reactions to IVIG, including aseptic meningitis, while providing continuous immune protection.\n\nB. Pre‑infusion high‑dose corticosteroid (e.g., methylprednisolone 1 g IV): While corticosteroids can manage inflammation, administering a high dose like 1 g of methylprednisolone pre-infusion is not the standard first-line approach for preventing aseptic meningitis. It might be used for symptom management in severe reactions, but it doesn't address the underlying trigger mechanism of the IVIG itself. High-dose steroids also carry significant risks.\n\nC. Change IVIG product to a sucrose‑free, low‑osmolality formulation: Some IVIG formulations, particularly those containing sucrose, have been associated with a higher incidence of aseptic meningitis. Switching to a sucrose-free formulation is a reasonable step and could potentially prevent the reaction if sucrose is the culprit. However, aseptic meningitis can occur with various IVIG formulations, and this change might not be as consistently effective as altering the entire delivery method.\n\nD. Administer IVIG at a slower infusion rate (e.g., over 72 hours) with pre‑hydration: Slowing the infusion rate and ensuring adequate hydration are standard measures to reduce general IVIG infusion reactions (e.g., flu-like symptoms). However, aseptic meningitis often occurs hours after the infusion is completed, suggesting it might be related to the systemic load of IgG rather than the rate of administration itself. Prolonging the infusion to 72 hours is also an extreme measure for standard IVIG. While a slower rate might help, it may not fully prevent this specific type of reaction.\n\nE. Replace IVIG with prophylactic antibiotics and as‑needed plasma infusions: This would be inadequate for immune protection in CVID. IVIG provides essential antibody replacement to prevent infections. Prophylactic antibiotics are supportive but do not replace immunoglobulin function, and as-needed plasma infusions are not a substitute for regular immunoglobulin therapy.\n\nComparing options A and C, switching to SCIG represents a more fundamental change in how the immunoglobulin is delivered, addressing the pharmacokinetic profile (avoiding large boluses) which is often implicated in delayed central nervous system reactions like aseptic meningitis. While changing formulation is a valid consideration, SCIG has a higher likelihood of preventing such severe, recurrent reactions while ensuring continuous and adequate immune coverage.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$."}]
