The CSF shows elevated pressure but essentially normal cell count, protein, and glucose with negative cultures, which is characteristic.\n\nEvaluating Options:\n\nA. Switch to SCIG: Subcutaneous immunoglobulin has a much lower rate of systemic adverse reactions including aseptic meningitis. SCIG provides steady-state IgG levels without the high peak concentrations seen with IVIG, which may contribute to aseptic meningitis. This maintains immune protection effectively.\n\nB. High-dose corticosteroids: While premedication with steroids can help with some IVIG reactions, using 1g methylprednisolone monthly carries significant long-term risks and may not reliably prevent aseptic meningitis.\n\nC. Sucrose-free, low-osmolality formulation: This is more relevant for preventing renal complications (osmotic nephrosis) rather than aseptic meningitis.\n\nD. Slower infusion rate: While slowing infusion can help with rate-related reactions, aseptic meningitis is not typically a rate-dependent reaction. A 72-hour infusion is impractical and may not prevent this complication.\n\nE. Replace with prophylactic antibiotics: This would not provide adequate immune protection for CVID patients who need immunoglobulin replacement. Antibiotics alone cannot replace the broad humoral immunity provided by immunoglobulin.\n\nBest Answer: Switching to SCIG (Option A) is the most evidence-based approach for patients with recurrent aseptic meningitis from IVIG. SCIG has been shown to have significantly lower rates of systemic adverse reactions while providing equivalent immune protection.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}]
