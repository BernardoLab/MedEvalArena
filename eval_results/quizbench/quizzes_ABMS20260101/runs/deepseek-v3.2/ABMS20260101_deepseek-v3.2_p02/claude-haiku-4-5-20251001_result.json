This is a bronchopleural fistula (BPF).\n\nPathophysiology:\n- Partial dehiscence of the bronchial stump\n- Air leak into the pleural space\n- Decreased chest tube output suggests the fistula is sealing partially or the tube is clogged\n- Mediastinal shift toward the defect indicates negative pressure on that side\n\nManagement Options Analysis:\n\nA. Emergency rethoracotomy with direct stump revision - This is definitive surgical repair but may be too aggressive as an immediate first step for a partial dehiscence without complete disruption.\n\nB. Placement of a second chest tube to water seal - This addresses the immediate problem by:\n- Allowing continued drainage\n- Preventing air from being sucked back in\n- Stabilizing the mediastinum\n- Buying time for the partial dehiscence to potentially seal\n- This is a temporizing measure that can prevent acute deterioration\n\nC. Bedside reopening - Too aggressive and risks contamination\n\nD. Endobronchial valve - Could work but requires specialized equipment and expertise; not typically first-line for acute management\n\nE.

A second chest tube to water seal is the most appropriate immediate intervention - it's less invasive than rethoracotomy, addresses the acute hemodynamic problem, and allows time for potential spontaneous sealing of the partial dehiscence.\n\nThe answer is B"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p02", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p02-009", "question": "A 68-year-old woman with a history of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for descending aortic aneurysm presents with hoarseness and dysphagia.
