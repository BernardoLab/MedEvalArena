Metastasis-directed SBRT to the involved node - For oligometastatic prostate cancer (especially with 1-3 metastases), metastasis-directed therapy (MDT) with SBRT has shown benefit in delaying systemic therapy and improving progression-free survival. The ORIOLE and STOMP trials support this approach. This targets the single lesion with high precision and minimal toxicity.\n\nD. Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection - Surgical approach is possible but more invasive for a single node, and SBRT is generally preferred in this setting.\n\nE. Re-initiation of ADT with docetaxel - This is aggressive systemic therapy typically reserved for high-volume metastatic disease, not oligometastatic recurrence.\n\nBest Answer:\nFor isolated oligometastatic recurrence detected on PSMA PET/CT, metastasis-directed SBRT represents the most appropriate definitive management. It offers local control of the visible disease while potentially delaying the need for systemic therapy, with minimal toxicity.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p02", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p02-008", "question": "A 52-year-old man undergoes right pneumonectomy for T3N2M0 non-small cell lung cancer.

Mediastinal shift toward the LEFT indicates:\n- Air/fluid is accumulating in the right hemithorax pushing the mediastinum away\n- This is consistent with bronchopleural fistula (BPF) with air leak into the pneumonectomy space\n\nThe bronchoscopy confirms a partial dehiscence (1.5 cm) of the bronchial stump.\n\nAnalyzing Options:\n\nA. Emergency rethoracotomy with direct stump revision - This is definitive treatment for BPF, but immediate surgery in an unstable patient with contaminated field carries high mortality. The dehiscence is partial, not complete.\n\nB. Placement of a second chest tube to water seal - This could help drain the pneumonectomy space and prevent tension, but doesn't address the underlying problem and may worsen contamination.\n\nC. Immediate bedside reopening with antibiotic irrigation - This is typically done for cardiac tamponade or massive hemorrhage, not for BPF management.\n\nD. Flexible bronchoscopic placement of an endobronchial valve - This is a minimally invasive approach that can occlude the bronchial stump, reduce air leak, and stabilize the patient. For a partial dehiscence (not complete disruption), this can be an effective temporizing or even definitive measure.\n\nE. Urgent ECMO followed by operative repair - This is aggressive and typically reserved for patients in extremis with refractory hypoxemia.\n\nBest Answer:\nFor a partial bronchial stump dehiscence (1.5 cm without frank disruption), endobronchial valve placement is an appropriate minimally invasive intervention that can seal the leak, stabilize the patient, and potentially avoid high-risk emergency surgery.

Endoleak with aneurysm sac expansion - This is a common complication post-TEVAR where the aneurysm sac continues to be pressurized, causing expansion and compression of adjacent structures\n2. The external compression on barium swallow supports mass effect from an expanding aneurysm sac\n3. Hoarseness suggests recurrent laryngeal nerve compression (Ortner's syndrome)\n\nEvaluating Options:\n\nA.

Direct laryngoscopy with vocal cord medialization - This addresses the symptom (hoarseness) but not the underlying cause\n\nC. Esophageal stent placement - This treats dysphagia symptomatically but doesn't address the etiology and is inappropriate for external compression\n\nD.

The negative cytology doesn't rule out malignancy (sensitivity ~60-70%), but we need to address the immediate problem of recurrent effusion.\n\nEvaluating Options:\n\nA. Repeat pericardiocentesis and colchicine - Colchicine is useful for recurrent idiopathic/viral pericarditis, but this presentation with rapid reaccumulation of serosanguinous fluid suggests a more aggressive process. Repeat pericardiocentesis alone is not definitive.\n\nB. Surgical pericardial window (subxiphoid approach) - This provides continuous drainage, allows tissue biopsy for diagnosis, and is the standard approach for recurrent effusions, especially when etiology is unclear or when there's concern for malignancy. It's less invasive than thoracotomy.\n\nC. High-dose prednisone - Starting empiric steroids without a diagnosis could be harmful, especially if there's an underlying infection or malignancy. Not appropriate without further workup.\n\nD.

Intrapericardial bleomycin - This is used for malignant effusions, but cytology is negative and malignancy hasn't been confirmed.\n\nBest Answer:\nGiven the rapid reaccumulation, the need for definitive drainage, and the need for tissue diagnosis, a pericardial window is the most appropriate next step. The subxiphoid approach is preferred as it's less invasive, provides adequate drainage, and allows for tissue biopsy.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}]
