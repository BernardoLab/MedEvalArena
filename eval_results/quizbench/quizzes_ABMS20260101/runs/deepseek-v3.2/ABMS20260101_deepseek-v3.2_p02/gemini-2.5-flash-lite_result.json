Kaposi's sarcoma in transplant recipients is primarily driven by immunosuppression, which allows for the reactivation and proliferation of HHV-8.\n\nThe goal of treatment for transplant-associated KS is to manage the underlying immunosuppression while also potentially targeting the tumor itself. Addressing the immunosuppression is considered the cornerstone of therapy.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is not a standard treatment for Kaposi's sarcoma.\nB. Rituximab targets CD20+ B cells. While HHV-8 can infect B cells, and some KS cases may have a B cell association (e.g., in the context of lymphoproliferative disorders), Rituximab is not considered the primary or most targeted treatment for HHV-8-associated KS.\nC. Sirolimus conversion: Sirolimus is an mTOR inhibitor. mTOR inhibitors have been shown to have antiproliferative and antiangiogenic properties, which are directly relevant to the pathogenesis of KS. In transplant recipients, switching from conventional immunosuppressants (like calcineurin inhibitors such as tacrolimus, or anti-metabolites like mycophenolate) to an mTOR inhibitor is a well-established, highly effective strategy for managing KS. It modulates the immune system in a way that can suppress KS growth and can be considered a targeted therapy because it addresses both the immunosuppressive milieu and has direct anti-tumor effects.\nD.

Three years later, a new 2.5 cm enhancing mass is found in the left renal pelvis. This scenario strongly suggests a metachronous upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC). UTUC is known to occur in patients with a history of bladder cancer, and these tumors often behave aggressively.\n\nThe standard and most appropriate treatment for localized UTUC is radical nephroureterectomy with excision of a cuff of the bladder. This procedure removes the kidney, the entire ureter, and the peri-ureteral tissue in the bladder wall to ensure complete removal of the tumor and prevent recurrence along the urothelial tract.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\nA. Percutaneous biopsy of the renal pelvis mass: While a biopsy can confirm the diagnosis, for lesions in the renal pelvis, ureteroscopy with biopsy is generally preferred over percutaneous biopsy, which carries a risk of tumor seeding along the needle tract and is less ideal for exophytic renal pelvis lesions. Furthermore, for a suspected UTUC that is resectable, proceeding directly to definitive surgical management may be appropriate without a preliminary biopsy to avoid delays and potential complications, especially if the mass is large and concerning for high grade.\n\nB. Systemic chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin: This is typically used for metastatic urothelial carcinoma or as neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy in select cases of muscle-invasive bladder cancer or high-risk upper tract disease, but not as the initial management for a localized, presumed resectable mass.\n\nC. Left nephroureterectomy with bladder cuff excision: This is the standard surgical treatment for localized UTUC, offering the best chance for cure. Given the history of high-grade bladder cancer and the characteristics of the new mass (enhancing, 2.5 cm), UTUC is highly suspected, and this surgical option is the most appropriate definitive management.\n\nD.

Inverted papilloma is locally aggressive and has a high recurrence rate, making complete surgical resection with clear margins essential to minimize recurrence.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\nA. Transnasal endoscopic medial maxillectomy: This approach uses an endoscope inserted through the nose to access and resect tumors within the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. It offers excellent visualization, magnification, and articulation, allowing for precise dissection and complete removal of sinonasal tumors, including those extending into the maxillary sinus and involving its walls. A medial maxillectomy specifically addresses the medial wall involvement. This method is considered minimally invasive and can achieve complete resection, thus minimizing recurrence rates.\n\nB. Caldwell-Luc antrostomy: This is an external approach through the gingivobuccal sulcus to access the maxillary sinus. It provides limited access to the medial wall and the nasal cavity and is not ideal for complete en bloc resection of inverted papilloma with nasal cavity involvement and medial wall erosion. It is more commonly used for chronic sinusitis or tumors primarily affecting the anterior/inferior maxillary sinus.\n\nC. Lateral rhinotomy with en bloc resection: This is an external, open approach that provides wider access than endoscopic surgery but is more invasive. It can be used for larger or more complex tumors, but for IPs confined to the sinonasal region and maxillary sinus, a transnasal endoscopic approach may offer comparable or better outcomes with less morbidity and better cosmesis for achieving complete resection.\n\nD. Midface degloving approach: This is a very extensive open approach involving de-gloving the midface. It is typically reserved for very large, extensive tumors involving multiple facial structures, the orbit, or the skull base. For the described extent of disease, this approach is likely overly aggressive.\n\nE. Radical maxillectomy via Weber-Ferguson incision: This is a significant open resection of the maxilla, usually employed for malignant tumors or extensive benign tumors with bone destruction or significant orbital involvement. For an inverted papilloma without evidence of malignancy or extensive bony invasion beyond the medial wall, this is generally considered too radical and associated with substantial morbidity.\n\nConsidering the goal of minimizing recurrence for inverted papilloma with sinonasal and maxillary sinus involvement, the transnasal endoscopic approach offers the best balance of complete tumor resection, detailed visualization, and minimally invasive technique.

Radiographs show appropriate component positioning without loosening. This clinical picture is indicative of arthrofibrosis, which is the formation of excessive scar tissue post-surgery, leading to restricted range of motion (ROM) and pain.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Manipulation under anesthesia (MUA): This is a procedure where the surgeon forcefully moves the knee through its range of motion under anesthesia. It is often effective for early, pliable adhesions, typically within the first few weeks to months post-surgery. While 3 months is still a potential window, it may be less effective for more established, fibrotic adhesions compared to earlier interventions.\n\nB. Arthroscopic lysis of adhesions: This involves using an arthroscope to visualize and surgically release scar tissue that is restricting motion. For established arthrofibrosis at 3 months post-TKA, especially when conservative therapy has not yielded sufficient results, arthroscopic lysis of adhesions is a common and effective treatment. It allows for direct visualization and targeted release of the offending adhesions, leading to improved ROM.\n\nC. Open quadricepsplasty: This is a more extensive surgical procedure involving release of the quadriceps mechanism. it is generally reserved for severe, recalcitrant stiffness that has not responded to less invasive treatments. At 3 months post-TKA with the described limitations, it is likely too aggressive as an initial surgical step.\n\nD. Revision arthroplasty with thicker polyethylene insert: This would be indicated if there were evidence of implant loosening, significant wear, or instability contributing to pain and stiffness. The radiographs do not show loosening, and the primary issue is stiffness, not an implant problem.\n\nE. Intensive physical therapy with dynamic splinting: Physical therapy is crucial for post-operative recovery and is the first line of defense against stiffness. Dynamic splinting aims to provide a sustained stretch to increase ROM over time. However, the term \"persistent\" pain and stiffness, along with a 15° contracture and significantly limited active flexion at 3 months, suggests that conservative physical therapy alone may no longer be sufficient to overcome the established scar tissue. If the patient has already undergone a course of appropriate physical therapy without significant improvement, this option might not be the *next most appropriate* step. However, if the patient has not yet had an intensive program focused on this issue, it could be considered. In the context of typical management algorithms for significant post-TKA stiffness after the initial recovery phase, operative intervention is usually considered when conservative measures fail.\n\nComparing options A and B, arthroscopic lysis of adhesions (B) is generally considered more effective and safer than MUA (A) for releasing well-established adhesions that cause contractures at 3 months post-operatively. It offers direct visualization, allowing for precise removal of scar tissue. If we assume \"persistent\" implies that standard conservative measures (including potentially less intensive PT) have not resolved the issue, then moving to a procedure to directly address the adhesions is indicated. Arthroscopic lysis of adhesions is the standard procedure for this indication.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p02", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p02-005", "question": "A 22-year-old woman suffers a dog bite to the lower lip resulting in a through-and-through laceration involving approximately 40% of the vermilion.

Precise alignment of the vermilion border: The vermilion border is the junction between the lip and the skin and is crucial for the aesthetic appearance of the lip. Accurate alignment is vital for symmetry and avoiding a notched or uneven lip line.\n\nB. Primary nerve repair of the mental nerve branches: The mental nerves provide sensation to the lower lip. While sensation is important for comfort and proprioception, restoring motor function and structural integrity is generally prioritized in acute lip laceration repair for immediate functional and aesthetic outcomes. Nerve repair for sensation is often considered after the main structural repair, unless the nerve injury significantly impacts the planned reconstruction or causes overwhelming functional deficit.\n\nC. Reconstruction of the orbicularis oris muscle continuity: The orbicularis oris is the sphincter muscle of the lips, responsible for lip closure, whistling, eating, and speech. A through-and-through laceration involving 40% of the lower lip vermilion will necessarily involve a significant portion of the orbicularis oris muscle fibers. If this muscle is not meticulously repaired, the lip will lose its tone and function, leading to impaired lip seal, drooling, difficulty speaking, and a significant aesthetic deformity (e.g., sagging lip). Restoring muscle continuity is fundamental to achieving both optimal functional and aesthetic results.\n\nD. Stent placement in Stensen's duct: Stensen's duct is the parotid salivary duct, which drains saliva from the parotid gland into the mouth. It opens on the buccal mucosa opposite the upper second molar. A laceration to the lower lip is unlikely to involve Stensen's duct. This option is irrelevant to the presented injury.\n\nE. Z-plasty at the commissure to prevent microstomia: Microstomia (abnormal smallness of the mouth opening) can result from scar contracture, particularly from burns or severe trauma causing significant tissue loss or involvement of the oral commissures. While a Z-plasty can be used to lengthen oral commissures if contracture is present or anticipated, it is not the primary critical immediate step for a through-and-through laceration of the body of the lower lip itself, unless the commissure is specifically involved or there is significant tissue loss demanding secondary reconstruction techniques.\n\nComparing options A and C:\nBoth are critical for the outcome. However, the question asks for the *most* critical consideration for *optimal aesthetic and functional reconstruction*.\nThe orbicularis oris muscle is responsible for the basic function and structural integrity of the lip. Without repairing its continuity, the lip will be flaccid, unable to close properly, leading to severe functional deficits (drooling, speech difficulties) and a poor aesthetic outcome due to the lack of muscle support and tone.\nThe vermilion border alignment is paramount for aesthetics, but it relies on a properly repaired underlying structure. If the muscle is not repaired, even a perfectly aligned vermilion border will be on a non-functional and deformed lip. Therefore, restoring the muscle continuity (function) is the prerequisite for achieving optimal results, forming the foundation upon which excellent aesthetics can be built.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p02", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p02-006", "question": "A 45-year-old woman with neurofibromatosis type 1 presents with progressive paraparesis over 3 months.

The MRI findings describe a large intradural extramedullary spinal tumor with extensions, causing spinal cord displacement. Progressive paraparesis indicates significant neurological compromise.\n\nDuring surgery, the tumor is found to be highly vascular and adherent to nerve roots. The loss of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in the lower extremities after partial debulking is a critical event, signifying ongoing injury to the motor pathways. This injury is likely due to compression, ischemia, or mechanical traction on the spinal cord or nerve roots during the resection process. Given the tumor's adherence to nerve roots, excessive retraction or manipulation is a probable cause for the decreasing MEP signals.\n\nThe goal of surgery is maximal safe tumor resection. When MEP monitoring indicates neurological compromise, the immediate response should aim to identify the cause and modify the surgical technique to protect neural structures.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. Aborting surgery and closing is a drastic measure, usually considered only if continued resection is deemed impossible or excessively dangerous, and attempts to mitigate the MEP loss have failed.\nB. Continuing resection without modifying the technique that led to MEP loss is likely to result in irreversible neurological damage. MEPs can be transient, but significant loss requires careful evaluation and adjustment, not just continuation.\nC. High-dose methylprednisolone is primarily used for spinal cord edema and inflammation, often postoperatively. While it might reduce swelling, it is not the first-line intraoperative management for acute MEP loss due to mechanical irritation or traction during resection.\nD. While malignant transformation is a concern in NF1, obtaining an immediate frozen section is not the priority when MEPs are lost. The immediate goal is to preserve neurological function. The histological diagnosis is secondary to managing the acute functional deficit.\nE. Switching to intracapsular ultrasonic aspiration is a technique that involves precise, piecemeal removal of tumor from its interior. This method minimizes the need for gross retraction and traction on surrounding delicate neural structures, such as nerve roots and the spinal cord. By debulking the tumor from the inside, it helps to relieve pressure and reduce tension, potentially allowing for MEP recovery and enabling continued, safer resection. This approach directly addresses the most probable cause of MEP loss (traction/pressure on nerve roots/cord) and offers a means to continue the surgery with greater safety.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate intraoperative response is to switch to a more delicate and precise technique like ultrasonic aspiration to minimize nerve root traction and further injury to the spinal cord.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{E}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p02", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p02-007", "question": "A 72-year-old man with Gleason 4+5=9 adenocarcinoma of the prostate, cT3bN1M0, completes definitive intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to prostate and pelvis to 79.2 Gy with 2 years of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).

Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT has detected a single, isolated, PSMA-avid retroperitoneal lymph node. This scenario represents oligometastatic disease. The goal of management is to treat this identified metastatic site definitively.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. Salvage extended field radiotherapy to include the retroperitoneum: While radiotherapy is a treatment option, re-irradiating a region already treated with high-dose IMRT can be limited by radiation tolerance of surrounding organs at risk and potential for cumulative toxicity. Also, SBRT offers a more focal and potentially higher ablative dose to the specific lesion.\nB. Systemic therapy with enzalutamide or abiraterone: Systemic therapies are typically reserved for widespread metastatic disease or symptomatic disease, not for a single, isolated metastasis detected solely by PSMA PET/CT. This approach would be premature.\nC. Metastasis-directed stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to the involved node: SBRT is a highly effective ablative technique for treating oligometastatic lesions, including isolated lymph node metastases in prostate cancer. It delivers a high dose of radiation to the target lesion with precise targeting, aiming for local control. This is a recognized standard of care for oligometastatic recurrence detected by PSMA PET/CT.\nD. Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection: Surgical resection is an option, but SBRT is often preferred for treating a single identified recurrence, especially in patients who may not be ideal surgical candidates or when the goal is definitive ablation rather than staging or debulking.\nE. Re-initiation of ADT with docetaxel chemotherapy: Chemotherapy is indicated for symptomatic metastatic castrate-recuperative prostate cancer or rapidly progressing asymptomatic disease. This is considered overly aggressive for a single, anatomically localized recurrence.\n\nGiven the presence of a single, isolated, PSMA-avid metastasis, metastasis-directed therapy with SBRT to the involved node is the most appropriate definitive management.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p02", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p02-008", "question": "A 52-year-old man undergoes right pneumonectomy for T3N2M0 non-small cell lung cancer.

These findings, coupled with a bronchial stump dehiscence, strongly suggest a tension pneumothorax or a large bronchopleural fistula (BPF) with mediastinal involvement, causing significant air leak and mediastinal instability. The mediastinal shift towards the left indicates a buildup of pressure on the right side, pushing the mediastinum and trachea away.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\nA. Emergency rethoracotomy with direct stump revision: This addresses the root cause directly. A re-thoracotomy allows for inspection of the bronchial stump, revision of the closure if necessary, and management of any ensuing pleural contamination or empyema. This is the most direct and definitive treatment for a significant bronchial stump leak causing hemodynamic instability (implied by mediastinal shift and acute distress).\n\nB. Placement of a second chest tube to water seal: While a chest tube is crucial for drainage, a second tube to water seal is unlikely to resolve the acute tension and mediastinal shift caused by a dehiscent bronchial stump. It does not fix the source of the leak.\n\nC. Immediate bedside reopening of the incision with antibiotic irrigation: Bedside reopening of a thoracotomy incision is not a standard surgical procedure for managing complications like bronchial stump dehiscence. It would likely be unsterile and inadequate.\n\nD. Flexible bronchoscopic placement of an endobronchial valve in the right main bronchus: The right main bronchus has been surgically removed during the pneumonectomy. Placing a valve in it would be anatomically incorrect and futile. Valves are generally used to collapse distal lung segments, not to seal a main bronchial stump after pneumonectomy.\n\nE. Urgent veno-venous ECMO cannulation followed by operative repair: ECMO is a life support measure for severe respiratory failure. While the patient has acute respiratory distress, ECMO is a bridge to definitive treatment. The primary issue is a surgically correctable problem. If the patient is too unstable for immediate surgical intervention, ECMO might be a consideration, but the most appropriate *immediate management of the dehiscence* in a situation where re-operation is feasible is surgical repair. Given the signs of tension, direct surgical intervention to relieve pressure and fix the leak is paramount.\n\nConsidering the acute mediastinal shift and respiratory distress, an emergency re-thoracotomy to directly address the bronchial stump dehiscence is the most appropriate immediate management.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p02", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p02-009", "question": "A 68-year-old woman with a history of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for descending aortic aneurysm presents with hoarseness and dysphagia.

Her history of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for a descending aortic aneurysm is highly relevant. The descending aorta is located posterior to the esophagus and the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which can cause hoarseness if compressed. A TEVAR graft, particularly its proximal extent, or complications like endoleaks leading to graft migration or pseudoaneurysm formation, can exert extrinsic pressure on these structures.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. Revision TEVAR with proximal extension: This is a potential therapeutic intervention if the TEVAR is indeed the cause. However, the phrase \"with proximal extension\" is concerning, as compression might already be caused by the existing proximal part of the graft. Without confirming the exact nature of the TEVAR-related issue, this carries significant procedural risk and might not be the best initial step.\n\nB. Direct laryngoscopy with vocal cord medialization: This would address the symptom of hoarseness by treating vocal cord dysfunction, but it does not address the underlying cause of esophageal compression (dysphagia) or the root cause of the nerve compression. It is a palliative measure for one symptom.\n\nC. Esophageal stent placement: This could relieve dysphagia by creating a lumen through the compressed segment. However, it does not address the hoarseness and bypasses the underlying problem. Furthermore, placing a stent against a vascular graft could lead to complications such as erosion or fistula formation.\n\nD. CT angiography of the chest with 3D reconstruction: This is a diagnostic imaging study. Given the history of TEVAR and the symptoms suggesting external compression, CT angiography is the best modality to non-invasively visualize the aorta, the stent graft, its position, any signs of migration or endoleaks, and its precise relationship with the esophagus and recurrent laryngeal nerve. This will confirm the most likely etiology (TEVAR complication) and provide critical anatomical detail to guide appropriate management while minimizing procedural risk, as it is a diagnostic step rather than an intervention.\n\nE. Open surgical aneurysm repair via left thoracotomy: This is a major surgical procedure with significant morbidity and mortality, especially in a patient with previous aortic repair. It is a definitive treatment but is not the most appropriate initial step for diagnosis and risk minimization when a less invasive diagnostic approach like CT angiography is available.\n\nThe question asks for a management strategy that addresses the most likely etiology (TEVAR complication) *while minimizing procedural risk*.

Repeat pericardiocentesis and initiate colchicine: Repeat pericardiocentesis is a temporary measure, and the effusion has already recurred. Colchicine is used for recurrent pericarditis (inflammation) and might help reduce effusion formation if inflammation is the primary driver, but it's not the definitive treatment for recurrent tamponade physiology due to a large effusion.\nB. Surgical creation of a pericardial window via subxiphoid approach: A pericardial window allows for continuous drainage of the pericardial fluid into the pleural or peritoneal cavity, thereby preventing fluid accumulation in the pericardium and resolving tamponade. This is a standard definitive management for recurrent, symptomatic pericardial effusion causing tamponade when pericardiocentesis is insufficient. The subxiphoid approach is a minimally invasive method.\nC. Initiation of high-dose prednisone for suspected autoimmune pericarditis: While autoimmune causes can lead to pericardial effusion, high-dose steroids take time to work and might not be sufficient for a rapidly reaccumulating effusion causing tamponade. A definitive drainage procedure like a pericardial window is often preferred when tamponade is recurrent and severe, especially if the response to medical management is uncertain or delayed.\nD. Pericardiectomy via left thoracotomy: Pericardiectomy is the removal of the pericardium and is indicated for constrictive pericarditis, not for managing recurrent pericardial effusion and tamponade.\nE. Intrapericardial instillation of bleomycin: Sclerotherapy (using agents like bleomycin) is an option for managing recurrent effusions, particularly malignant ones or when other methods fail. However, a pericardial window is generally considered the first-line surgical treatment for recurrent symptomatic effusion/tamponade due to its effectiveness and relative invasiveness compared to some other sclerosing agents or procedures.\n\nGiven the recurrent, symptomatic nature of the effusion causing tamponade, a pericardial window is the most appropriate definitive management strategy.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}]
