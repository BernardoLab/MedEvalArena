Recent fall with subdural hematoma requiring reversal of apixaban 3 months ago: A past bleeding event requiring anticoagulation reversal is a concern for procedural bleeding risk. However, it is a past event, and anticoagulation management can be adjusted. It is a factor to consider but not necessarily the strongest argument against TAVR unless there is ongoing bleeding risk or intolerance to necessary anticoagulation.\n\nB. Moderate‑severe mitral regurgitation due to annular dilation: Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation can contribute to symptoms and affect outcomes after TAVR. Sometimes, MR needs to be addressed independently, or its presence may limit the benefit of TAVR. However, depending on the severity and symptom contribution, it might not be an absolute contraindication.\n\nC. Life expectancy estimated at less than 12 months due to metastatic lung cancer diagnosed 2 months ago: This is a critical factor. TAVR is a treatment intended to improve quality of life and prolong survival. If a patient has a terminal illness with a very limited life expectancy (less than 12 months), the potential benefits of TAVR are unlikely to be realized, and the risks and burden of the procedure (hospitalization, recovery, complications) may outweigh any potential benefit. This is generally considered a strong contraindication for elective or semi-elective procedures aimed at prolonging life.\n\nD. Frailty score consistent with slow gait and low grip strength but able to perform ADLs: Frailty is a known predictor of poor outcomes after TAVR. However, the ability to perform Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) suggests a degree of functional independence. While frailty is a risk modifier, it is not an absolute contraindication if the patient has the potential for significant functional improvement from TAVR and can tolerate the procedure.\n\nE. Asymptomatic 4 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm noted on pre‑TAVR CT: An asymptomatic infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm of 4 cm is generally considered small and requires monitoring, but it is not typically an immediate contraindication for TAVR. Intervention for AAA is usually considered for larger or symptomatic aneurysms.\n\nComparing the options, the most compelling argument against proceeding with TAVR is a significantly limited life expectancy due to metastatic cancer (Option C). The potential benefit of TAVR in improving quality of life and survival is severely diminished if the patient's prognosis is less than 12 months.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p04-002", "question": "A 9-month-old exclusively breastfed infant presents with severe metabolic acidosis (pH 7.18), lactic acidosis, hyperammonemia (250 μmol/L), and hypoglycemia.

The acute neurological deterioration is a critical concern, often driven by severe hyperammonemia.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\nA. IV carnitine 100 mg/kg: Carnitine supplementation is beneficial in many organic acidurias, including HMG-CoA lyase deficiency, as it helps conjugate with acyl-CoA esters and facilitates their excretion as acylcarnitines. This can reduce the accumulation of toxic intermediates. However, while important, it might not be the *most urgent* intervention compared to directly addressing life-threatening hyperammonemia.\n\nB. IV riboflavin 100 mg: Riboflavin is the treatment for Multiple Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency (MADD). The biochemical profile presented does not suggest MADD.\n\nC. IV biotin 10 mg: Biotin is the treatment for biotinidase deficiency or holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency. These conditions typically result in elevated methylmalonic acid and/or propionic acid, which are not the primary findings here.\n\nD. Oral glycine 250 mg/kg: Glycine therapy can help in managing hyperammonemia by forming glycine conjugates that are excreted in the urine, thereby removing nitrogen. It is used in some organic acidurias. However, the infant has acute neurological deterioration, suggesting that oral administration may not be the most effective or urgent route, and IV administration of more potent agents might be preferred.\n\nE. IV sodium benzoate 250 mg/kg: Sodium benzoate is a primary treatment for severe hyperammonemia. It conjugates with glycine to form hippurate, which is then excreted by the kidneys, providing an alternate pathway for nitrogen removal and lowering blood ammonia levels. Given the severity of hyperammonemia (250 μmol/L) and the associated acute neurological deterioration, directly targeting and reducing the ammonia concentration is the most urgent intervention to prevent irreversible brain damage and death.\n\nIn the context of acute metabolic decompensation with severe hyperammonemia and neurological compromise in a patient with HMG-CoA lyase deficiency, rapid reduction of ammonia is paramount.

Doxycycline is the drug of choice for RMSF.\n\nNow let's evaluate the pathophysiological mechanisms:\n\nA.  Direct bacterial invasion of myocardium causing microabscesses: While possible in some bacterial infections, *Rickettsia* primarily targets endothelial cells, not directly invading myocytes to form microabscesses in the heart as a primary mechanism.\n\nB.  Immune complex deposition in coronary vasculature: RMSF involves vasculitis, but the primary damage is characterized by direct endothelial cell infection and inflammation, leading to increased vascular permeability, rather than solely immune complex deposition in coronary arteries as the main driver of myocardial injury.\n\nC.  Rickettsial toxin-mediated coronary vasospasm: While endothelial dysfunction caused by RMSF can lead to ischemia, and vasospasm is a form of ischemia, the broader and more direct mechanism observed in RMSF cardiac involvement is damage to the endothelial lining of small vessels, leading to leakage and edema, rather than purely vasospasm.\n\nD.  Endothelial damage causing capillary leakage and myocardial edema: This is the central pathophysiological mechanism of RMSF. Infecting endothelial cells leads to widespread vasculitis, characterized by increased vascular permeability, edema, thrombosis, and hemorrhage. In the myocardium, this results in myocardial inflammation and edema, explaining the elevated troponin, diffuse ST elevations, and potential for syncope due to arrhythmias or impaired contractility. The pericardial effusion is also consistent with inflammation and increased permeability in the pericardial vessels.\n\nE.  Doxycycline-induced hypersensitivity myocarditis: The patient has just started doxycycline. While drug-induced myocarditis is possible, RMSF itself is a well-known cause of myocarditis and pericarditis. Given the prodromal symptoms and exposure history, RMSF is a much more direct and likely explanation for the cardiac findings appearing shortly after symptom onset and treatment initiation. Hypersensitivity reactions typically develop days to weeks after starting a drug, though acute reactions are possible.

Increase sevoflurane concentration to 1.2 MAC: Volatile anesthetics like sevoflurane suppress MEPs by impairing synaptic transmission. Increasing the concentration would likely worsen the MEP signal, not restore it.\nB. Administer ketamine 0.5 mg/kg IV: Ketamine can cause sympathetic stimulation, potentially increasing blood pressure and improving perfusion. It also has neuroprotective properties and is less suppressive to MEPs than volatile agents or high-dose propofol. This is a plausible option, but less direct than addressing the primary hypotension.\nC. Increase remifentanil infusion rate: Opioids like remifentanil generally have less impact on MEPs compared to volatile anesthetics or propofol at high doses, but they can contribute to hypotension. Increasing the infusion rate might not be beneficial if hypotension is the primary issue.\nD. Administer phenylephrine to MAP 90 mmHg: Phenylephrine is a pure alpha-adrenergic agonist that increases systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure. Addressing the low MAP of 65 mmHg by raising it to a target of 90 mmHg would directly improve spinal cord perfusion pressure, which is the most likely cause of MEP loss in this scenario. This is a standard intervention for MEP loss due to hypotension.\nE. Decrease propofol infusion by 50%: Propofol, especially at high doses for TIVA, can suppress MEPs. Decreasing the infusion would help if anesthetic depth is the primary cause of signal loss. However, the explicitly stated low MAP of 65 mmHg is a significant factor suggesting perfusion compromise. While decreasing propofol might help, correcting the hypotension is often prioritized.\n\nGiven that the MAP is 65 mmHg, which is low for adequate spinal cord perfusion during surgery, the most direct and likely intervention to restore MEP signals is to increase the MAP to improve spinal cord blood flow.

High-dose intravenous steroids: Steroids are not indicated for ischemic colitis. They can worsen outcomes by impairing healing and potentially increasing the risk of infection.\nB. Emergent colectomy with end ileostomy: Surgical intervention is reserved for patients with severe, transmural ischemia, perforation, gangrene, or refractory disease despite conservative management. The description of mucosal edema, ulceration, and friability, while concerning, does not definitively indicate transmural necrosis or peritonitis, which would necessitate immediate surgery. Therefore, emergent colectomy is not the most appropriate *initial* management.\nC.

They are not the primary treatment for the ischemia itself.\nD. Bowel rest and intravenous fluids: This is the cornerstone of initial management for ischemic colitis. Placing the bowel at rest (NPO status) reduces metabolic demand and allows for healing.

The echocardiogram shows a hyperdynamic left ventricle with near-cavity obliteration, which are markers of high LV systolic pressure and potential for SAM.\n\nLet's analyze the pharmacologic options in this context:\n\n*   A. Intravenous phenylephrine infusion: Phenylephrine is a pure alpha-1 adrenergic agonist. Its primary effect is peripheral vasoconstriction, leading to an increase in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and consequently, an increase in blood pressure. In patients with dynamic LVOT obstruction (like SAM), increasing SVR can be beneficial. It increases the pressure in the aorta, which reduces the pressure gradient across the LVOT, thereby diminishing the SAM and the obstruction. This can improve forward flow and coronary perfusion, especially in a hypotensive patient. While increasing afterload is generally avoided in pure AS, in the presence of significant dynamic LVOT obstruction causing hypotension, this strategy can be a critical first step for hemodynamic stabilization.\n\n*   B. Intravenous esmolol infusion: Esmolol is a beta-blocker. Beta-blockers reduce heart rate and contractility. In severe AS, reducing contractility can decrease cardiac output. In the presence of LVOT obstruction, further reduction in contractility can worsen the SAM and increase the LVOT gradient, leading to reduced forward flow and more hypotension. This is generally contraindicated in severe AS and LVOT obstruction, especially in a hypotensive patient.\n\n*   C. Intravenous nitroglycerin infusion: Nitroglycerin is a vasodilator that reduces both preload and afterload. While afterload reduction might seem beneficial for AS, its potent preload-lowering effect would reduce LV filling. Reduced LV volume exacerbates SAM and LVOT obstruction, and decreased preload would further worsen blood pressure in an already hypotensive patient. This is contraindicated.\n\n*   D. Intravenous furosemide bolus: Furosemide is a diuretic that reduces preload by promoting diuresis. In a hypotensive patient, further reducing preload with furosemide would be detrimental, leading to worsened LVOT obstruction, reduced cardiac output, and increased hypotension. This is contraindicated.\n\n*   E. Intravenous milrinone infusion: Milrinone is a phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor with inotropic and vasodilatory properties. As an inotrope, it increases cardiac contractility, which can worsen SAM and LVOT obstruction. Its vasodilatory effect decreases SVR and blood pressure, which would worsen the hypotension and potentially the LVOT obstruction. This combination makes it inappropriate for this patient.\n\nGiven the severe hypotension and the presence of significant dynamic LVOT obstruction superimposed on severe AS, the immediate priority is to stabilize blood pressure and reduce the functional outflow tract obstruction. Phenylephrine is the most appropriate choice as it increases SVR and blood pressure, which can paradoxically reduce the LVOT gradient and improve forward flow in this specific complex scenario, while the other options are likely to worsen the patient's condition.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p04-010", "question": "A 40-year-old woman presents with palpitations, heat intolerance, and weight loss.

This indicates that the thyroid gland is actively synthesizing excess thyroid hormone, ruling out conditions like subacute thyroiditis orfactitious thyrotoxicosis where uptake would be low.\n\nThe ultrasound shows a 2 cm hypoechoic nodule.\nThe RAIU scan also reveals a photopenic area corresponding to the nodule, meaning this nodule has decreased iodine uptake compared to the surrounding thyroid tissue.\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on these findings:\n\nA. Graves' disease with a coexisting cold nodule: Graves' disease is characterized by diffuse, homogeneous, and often markedly increased radioactive iodine uptake due to the presence of TSH receptor antibodies stimulating the entire gland. The finding of a photopenic nodule (cold nodule) indicates that this specific nodule is not functioning as the rest of the gland is. This is a common incidental finding in patients with Graves' disease, and the diffuse uptake points towards Graves' being the primary cause of the hyperthyroidism. This is a strong possibility.\n\nB. Toxic multinodular goiter (TMNG): TMNG typically presents with multiple autonomous nodules that produce excess thyroid hormone. The RAIU scan in TMNG usually shows uptake localized to the nodules (\"hot\" nodules) with suppressed uptake in the extranodular tissue. While diffuse uptake can be seen, the presence of a single *cold* nodule with diffuse *increased* uptake is not typical for TMNG.\n\nC. Subacute thyroiditis: Subacute thyroiditis is an inflammatory process where pre-formed hormone is released into circulation. During the hyperthyroid phase, the thyroid gland's ability to synthesize new hormone is impaired, resulting in characteristically *low* radioactive iodine uptake. The high uptake seen in this patient rules out subacute thyroiditis in the hyperthyroid phase.\n\nD. Factitious thyrotoxicosis: This condition results from exogenous ingestion of thyroid hormone. The high levels of exogenous hormone suppress endogenous TSH production, leading to decreased or absent synthesis of thyroid hormone by the patient's own thyroid gland. Consequently, the RAIU would be very low. The diffusely increased uptake rules out factitious thyrotoxicosis.\n\nE. Marine-Lenhart syndrome (Graves' disease with a functioning nodule): This syndrome describes the coexistence of Graves' disease with a hyperfunctioning (hot) autonomous nodule. The RAIU scan would show diffuse uptake characteristic of Graves' PLUS a focal area of significantly increased uptake within a nodule. In this case, the nodule is described as photopenic (cold), not functioning. Therefore, Marine-Lenhart syndrome is not the correct diagnosis.\n\nConclusion: The diffusely increased RAIU is the key finding pointing to Graves' disease as the cause of hyperthyroidism. The photopenic nodule is an incidental finding that does not negate the diagnosis of Graves' disease.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$."}]
