However, 3 months have passed, and anticoagulation management can be adjusted. This is a relative contraindication but not absolute.\n\nOption B: Moderate-severe mitral regurgitation due to annular dilation\nFunctional MR often improves after TAVR due to reduced afterload. This is not a contraindication and may actually benefit from the procedure.\n\nOption C: Life expectancy estimated at less than 12 months due to metastatic lung cancer diagnosed 2 months ago\nThis is a critical factor. TAVR is intended to improve quality of life and survival. If life expectancy is less than 12 months due to a competing terminal illness (metastatic lung cancer), the patient is unlikely to benefit from the procedure. Guidelines specifically state that TAVR should not be performed if the patient's life expectancy is limited by non-cardiac conditions to less than 1 year, as the procedure would be considered futile.\n\nOption D: Frailty score consistent with slow gait and low grip strength but able to perform ADLs\nMild-moderate frailty with preserved ADL function is not a contraindication. In fact, frail patients who can still perform ADLs may benefit from TAVR. Severe frailty with inability to perform ADLs would be more concerning.\n\nOption E: Asymptomatic 4 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm noted on pre-TAVR CT\nA 4 cm AAA is below the threshold for repair (typically 5.5 cm in men, 5.0 cm in women).

Broad-spectrum antibiotics - Part of management but not the primary initial approach for non-gangrenous disease\n\nD. Bowel rest and IV fluids - This is the standard initial management for non-gangrenous ischemic colitis. Supportive care allows mucosal healing in most cases.\n\nE. Endovascular stent in hypogastric arteries - Not the initial management; the damage is already done, and this wouldn't address acute mucosal ischemia\n\nBest Answer:\nFor non-gangrenous ischemic colitis (mucosal involvement only), the initial management is conservative/supportive care: bowel rest, IV fluids, and close monitoring. Surgery is reserved for those who develop signs of transmural necrosis or perforation.\n\nThe answer is (D)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p04-008", "question": "A 41-year-old woman with antiphospholipid syndrome (triple positive) on warfarin (INR 2.8) presents with acute right hemiparesis and aphasia.

IV tPA (Option A): This patient has a therapeutic INR of 2.8, which is a contraindication to IV tPA. IV alteplase is contraindicated when INR >1.7 due to increased bleeding risk.\n\n2. Mechanical thrombectomy (Option B): Current guidelines support mechanical thrombectomy for large vessel occlusions (like M1) within 6 hours (and up to 24 hours in select patients). Importantly, anticoagulation with warfarin is NOT a contraindication to mechanical thrombectomy. This is a major advantage in anticoagulated patients who cannot receive IV tPA.\n\n3. IV heparin (Option C): Not indicated for acute stroke treatment and would increase bleeding risk in an already anticoagulated patient.\n\n4.

Key findings:\n\n1. Hyperdynamic LV with near-cavity obliteration\n2. SAM with LVOT obstruction (peak gradient 120 mmHg)\n3. New eccentric posteriorly directed MR (classic for SAM-related MR)\n4. Hypotension (85/50 mmHg)\n\nThe pathophysiology here is dynamic LVOT obstruction, likely precipitated by hypovolemia or excessive preload reduction in the setting of a hyperdynamic, hypertrophied ventricle (from the AS). The SAM is causing both the LVOT obstruction and the MR.\n\nTreatment principles for dynamic LVOT obstruction with SAM:\n- Increase preload (volume)\n- Increase afterload (vasoconstrictors)\n- Decrease contractility (beta-blockers)\n- Avoid inotropes, vasodilators, and diuretics\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\nA. Phenylephrine - Pure alpha-agonist, increases afterload. This helps by increasing LV cavity size and reducing the Venturi effect that causes SAM. Good choice.\n\nB. Esmolol - Beta-blocker, reduces contractility and heart rate. This decreases the hyperdynamic state and allows more time for LV filling. Good choice.\n\nC. Nitroglycerin - Vasodilator - CONTRAINDICATED. Would worsen hypotension and decrease preload, worsening SAM and LVOT obstruction.\n\nD. Furosemide - Diuretic - CONTRAINDICATED. Would decrease preload, worsening the dynamic obstruction.\n\nE. Milrinone - Inodilator - CONTRAINDICATED. Would increase contractility and decrease afterload, dramatically worsening SAM and LVOT obstruction.\n\nBetween A and B: The patient is severely hypotensive (85/50). While both are appropriate, phenylephrine provides immediate hemodynamic support by increasing blood pressure and afterload, which directly addresses the hypotension and helps reduce the dynamic obstruction. Esmolol, while helpful for the hyperdynamic state, could potentially worsen hypotension initially.\n\nIn acute, severe hypotension with dynamic LVOT obstruction, phenylephrine is typically the first-line agent to stabilize blood pressure while addressing the underlying mechanism.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p04-010", "question": "A 40-year-old woman presents with palpitations, heat intolerance, and weight loss.
