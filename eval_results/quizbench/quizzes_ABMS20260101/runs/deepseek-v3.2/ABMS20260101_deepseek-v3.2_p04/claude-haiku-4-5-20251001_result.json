The hyperdynamic LV with cavity obliteration and SAM indicates:\n- Excessive contractility\n- Reduced LV cavity size\n- Anterior motion of mitral valve causing LVOT obstruction\n- Secondary severe MR from SAM\n\nWhat's causing this?\nThe patient is likely in cardiogenic shock from severe AS, and compensatory mechanisms have created a hyperdynamic state that paradoxically worsens the hemodynamic situation through dynamic obstruction.\n\nTreatment Principles for Dynamic LVOT Obstruction:\n- Increase afterload (increases LV cavity size, reduces SAM)\n- Decrease contractility (reduces dynamic obstruction)\n- Avoid: diuretics (reduce preload → smaller cavity → worse SAM), inotropes (increase contractility → worse SAM), vasodilators (reduce afterload → worse SAM)\n\nEvaluating Options:\n\nA. Phenylephrine - Increases afterload, increases LV cavity size, reduces SAM gradient. This is beneficial for dynamic LVOT obstruction.\n\nB. Esmolol - Beta-blocker reduces contractility and heart rate, beneficial for dynamic obstruction, but patient is hypotensive (contraindicated).\n\nC. Nitroglycerin - Vasodilator reduces afterload, worsens dynamic obstruction (contraindicated).\n\nD. Furosemide - Reduces preload, decreases LV cavity size, worsens SAM and dynamic obstruction (contraindicated).\n\nE. Milrinone - Inotrope + vasodilator, increases contractility and reduces afterload, worsens dynamic obstruction (contraindicated).\n\nAnswer:\nDespite the patient being hypotensive, phenylephrine is the most appropriate immediate intervention because it increases afterload, which increases LV cavity size and reduces the dynamic LVOT obstruction and SAM. This addresses the acute hemodynamic derangement. The hypotension is partly due to the dynamic obstruction itself.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p04", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p04-010", "question": "A 40-year-old woman presents with palpitations, heat intolerance, and weight loss.
