The affected eye has a shallow anterior chamber with high IOP, while the fellow eye has a deep anterior chamber with open angles. This asymmetry suggests this is NOT typical primary angle-closure glaucoma (which would typically show narrow angles bilaterally).\n\nIn a diabetic patient with:\n- Unilateral shallow anterior chamber\n- Very high IOP\n- Deep anterior chamber in the fellow eye\n\nThis presentation is classic for phacomorphic glaucoma - where an intumescent (swollen) cataractous lens causes secondary angle closure by pushing the iris forward.

The key principles here are:\n\n1. Time is critical: Acute limb ischemia requires urgent revascularization. The \"golden window\" for limb salvage is generally considered to be within 6-8 hours of ischemia onset to prevent irreversible muscle and nerve damage.\n\n2. Vascular repair takes priority: The immediate threat to the limb is the vascular compromise. Without blood flow, the limb will be lost regardless of ligament status.\n\n3. Ligament reconstruction is not emergent: While ligament injuries are important for long-term knee function, they can be addressed in a delayed fashion (typically 2-3 weeks later) once the vascular status is secured and soft tissue swelling has decreased.\n\n4. Staged approach is standard: The standard of care is immediate vascular repair followed by delayed ligament reconstruction. This allows:\n   - Immediate restoration of blood flow\n   - Assessment for compartment syndrome (which commonly occurs after reperfusion)\n   - Soft tissue healing before definitive ligament surgery\n   - Better surgical conditions for ligament reconstruction\n\n5.
