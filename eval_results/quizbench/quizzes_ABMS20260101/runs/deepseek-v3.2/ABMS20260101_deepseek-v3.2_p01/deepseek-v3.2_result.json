Cyclophosphamide is used in some refractory autoimmune lung diseases, but not first-line for irAE pneumonitis. Switching steroid types or small dose adjustments is unlikely to help if already on high-dose methylprednisolone.  \n\nCurrent NCCN/ASCO guidelines for steroid-refractory irAE pneumonitis (after 48–72 hours of high-dose steroids without improvement) recommend adding infliximab or mycophenolate mofetil. Among the choices provided, infliximab is the most appropriate and evidence-based next step.  \n\n**The answer is A**"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p01-010", "question": "A 70-year-old man with atrial fibrillation on apixaban (non-valvular) presents with acute onset of right-sided weakness and aphasia 4 hours after symptom onset.

Direct thrombectomy is non-inferior to bridging therapy (tPA + thrombectomy). Reversing anticoagulation to give tPA (C, D) delays definitive therapy and adds bleeding risk.
