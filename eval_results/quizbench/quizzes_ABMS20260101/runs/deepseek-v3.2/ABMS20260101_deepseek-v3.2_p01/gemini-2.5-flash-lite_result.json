Patient Presentation: 5-week-old infant with extreme irritability, CNS signs (hypertonia, arching), vomiting, loose stools, profound hyponatremia (115 mEq/L), hypochloremia, hyperkalemia, and severe metabolic acidosis.\n2.  Key Investigations: Markedly elevated plasma renin activity (PRA) and normal serum cortisol. Ultrasound shows bladder wall thickening and bilateral hydroureteronephrosis without posterior urethral valves.\n3.  Differential Diagnosis & Pathophysiology:\n    *   The electrolyte imbalance – hyponatremia, hypochloremia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis – is classic for mineralocorticoid deficiency or resistance. This means the body is not adequately reabsorbing sodium and excreting potassium and hydrogen ions in the renal tubules.\n    *   The normal cortisol rules out primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) where both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids are deficient.\n    *   The markedly elevated PRA indicates that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is activated, typically in response to low effective circulating volume and/or low serum sodium, trying to stimulate aldosterone production. However, if the problem is peripheral resistance to aldosterone (Pseudohypoaldosteronism - PHA), aldosterone and PRA will be high, but the kidney will not respond.\n    *   The urinary tract findings suggest a functional outflow obstruction or bladder dysfunction, which can sometimes lead to salt wasting and secondary activation of the RAAS. However, the extreme electrolyte derangement combined with high PRA in a neonate most strongly suggests primary pseudohypoaldosteronism or a salt-wasting form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (though PRA is usually suppressed in CAH due to ACTH feedback). Given normal cortisol and high PRA, pseudohypoaldosteronism is a strong contender.\n4.  Electrolyte Management Goals: The immediate priority is to correct the life-threatening electrolyte abnormalities:\n    *   Severe Hyponatremia: Na 115 mEq/L is very low and likely contributing to the CNS symptoms. It needs careful but sufficient increase to alleviate symptoms, avoiding rapid correction that could cause osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS).\n    *   Hyperkalemia: High potassium is cardiotoxic and can cause fatal arrhythmias. It needs to be lowered urgently.\n    *   Severe Metabolic Acidosis: Needs buffering and correction.\n5.  Evaluating the Options:\n    *   A. Isotonic saline boluses followed by fluid restriction to prevent sodium loss: Isotonic saline will not significantly raise serum sodium concentration in severe hyponatremia. Fluid restriction would worsen the hyponatremia. This strategy is inappropriate.\n    *   B. Hypertonic saline with sodium polystyrene sulfonate and sodium bicarbonate:\n        *   Hypertonic saline (e.g., 3% NaCl): This is the treatment of choice for symptomatic severe hyponatremia, providing the necessary sodium to raise serum levels cautiously.\n        *   Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate): This potassium binder exchanges sodium for potassium in the gut, thereby lowering serum potassium levels and addressing the hyperkalemia.\n        *   Sodium bicarbonate: This corrects the severe metabolic acidosis and also provides sodium, further aiding in hyponatremia management.\n        This option directly addresses the three most critical, life-threatening electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities simultaneously.\n    *   C. Isotonic saline with fludrocortisone to promote renal sodium reabsorption: Fludrocortisone is the definitive treatment for mineralocorticoid deficiency/resistance. However, it takes time to work. The question asks for electrolyte *management* pending diagnosis, implying stabilization. While fludrocortisone is crucial, it's not the immediate management of acute, severe electrolyte derangements. Furthermore, hyperkalemia must be addressed first before initiating a mineralocorticoid.\n    *   D. Normal saline boluses and maintenance fluids with added sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride: Adding potassium chloride would be dangerous in the presence of hyperkalemia. This option is life-threatening.\n    *   E. Withhold all sodium and potassium, provide glucose-only intravenous fluids to minimize tubular electrolyte load: Withholding sodium would worsen severe hyponatremia. Glucose-only fluids would further dilute serum sodium. This is the opposite of appropriate management.\n\n6.  Conclusion: Option B provides the most appropriate and comprehensive immediate management strategy for the critical electrolyte and acid-base derangements presented. It directly targets the hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis, which are the most pressing life-threats.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p01-002", "question": "A 68-year-old man presents to the ED with acute onset of 'rice-water' diarrhea profuse enough to require intravenous fluid resuscitation.

The stool sample is positive for *Vibrio cholerae*, even if it is a non-O1, non-O139 strain. The hallmark of cholera is the production of cholera toxin (CT) or toxins with similar effects, which lead to massive secretion of chloride and water into the intestinal lumen via activation of adenylyl cyclase. In non-O1, non-O139 strains, other toxins like heat-labile toxins or even CT can be produced, or toxins that mimic CT's effect of inducing secretory diarrhea.\n\nThe profuse fluid loss from this secretory diarrhea leads to profound hypovolemia and dehydration. This severe reduction in circulating volume leads to decreased renal perfusion, causing prerenal acute renal failure. If hypoperfusion is sustained, it can result in ischemic acute tubular necrosis. The profound metabolic acidosis with an elevated anion gap of 28 is consistent with lactic acidosis, a common complication of tissue hypoperfusion due to hypovolemia.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. Shiga-like toxin causing hemolytic uremic syndrome: Shiga-like toxins are associated with EHEC *E. coli* and *Shigella*. They cause HUS, characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure. This is not the mechanism for diarrhea caused by *Vibrio cholerae* or the observed renal failure pattern.\nB. Heat-stable enterotoxin inducing prerenal azotemia: While *Vibrio cholerae* can produce heat-stable enterotoxins, the description of 'rice-water' diarrhea strongly points to cholera toxin or a similar potent secretory toxin rather than heat-stable toxins alone, which typically cause less voluminous diarrhea. The mechanism of ARF is indeed hypovolemia leading to prerenal azotemia, but this option attributes it to a specific toxin type that may not be the primary driver.\nC. RTX toxin causing direct tubular epithelial necrosis: RTX toxins are a diverse group. While some *Vibrio* species produce RTX toxins with various functions, direct tubular necrosis is not the primary or most common mechanism for ARF in cholera compared to hypovolemia-induced injury.\nD. Zonula occludens toxin leading to ischemic acute tubular necrosis: Zonula occludens toxin (ZOT) disrupts intestinal tight junctions, increasing paracellular permeability and contributing to fluid loss. However, it is not the primary driver of massive secretory diarrhea causing profound hypovolemia, nor directly causing ATN independently of hypovolemia.\nE. Cholera toxin-like effect with profound hypovolemia: This option best describes the pathogenic process. A cholera toxin-like effect explains the production of massive secretory diarrhea ('rice-water' diarrhea). This profound fluid and electrolyte loss leads to severe hypovolemia. Profound hypovolemia is the direct cause of the renal failure pattern (prerenal azotemia progressing to ischemic ATN) and contributes significantly to the metabolic acidosis seen with elevated anion gap (lactic acidosis from hypoperfusion).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{E}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p01-003", "question": "A 32-year-old G2P1001 at 31 weeks gestation presents with acute-onset severe abdominal pain and hypotension.

Ultrasound reveals an adnexal mass and free fluid, with suspected ovarian torsion. Intraoperatively, the ovary is necrotic, and frozen section shows atypical cells, raising concern for malignancy.\n\nThe presence of atypical cells, even if not definitive for malignancy, necessitates thorough surgical staging. Standard staging for suspected ovarian cancer includes total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, peritoneal washings, peritoneal biopsies, and lymphadenectomy.\n\nHowever, the patient is 31 weeks pregnant. This significantly complicates the surgical approach, as aggressive dissection could compromise the pregnancy. The fetus is viable.\n\nLet's evaluate the options in light of these factors:\nA. Right oophorectomy only: Insufficient staging for suspected malignancy.\nB. Right oophorectomy with right pelvic lymph node sampling: Incomplete staging. Does not address the omentum or washings, nor the contralateral ovary.\nC. Right oophorectomy with infracolic omentectomy and pelvic washings: This option addresses the immediate problem of the torsed ovary, removes the necessary ovary, and includes crucial initial staging components (omentectomy and washings) that help assess for metastasis. Crucially, it preserves the uterus and contralateral ovary, which is important for potentially continuing the pregnancy and preserving fertility. This allows for delivery of the infant, followed by definitive surgical staging and treatment for any confirmed malignancy.\nD. Right salpingo-oophorectomy with left ovarian biopsy and appendectomy: While addressing both adnexa to some extent, a biopsy is less definitive than removal if suspicion is high.

This clinical picture is highly suggestive of a carcinoid crisis, which is triggered by the release of vasoactive substances (like serotonin, histamine, bradykinin, or tachykinins) from the tumor. These substances cause vasodilation and potentially bronchoconstriction, leading to severe hypotension and other symptoms.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. Intravenous octreotide: Octreotide is a somatostatin analogue that inhibits the release of many neuroendocrine peptides, including serotonin and other vasoactive substances secreted by carcinoid tumors. It is the cornerstone of medical management for carcinoid syndrome and is the most effective agent to treat a carcinoid crisis by reducing the mediator release responsible for the vasodilation causing hypotension.\n\nB. Intravenous corticosteroids: Corticosteroids are not the primary treatment for acute hypotension in a carcinoid crisis, although they may be used in chronic management or for specific symptoms like flushing refractory to other treatments.\n\nC. Intravenous β-blocker: Beta-blockers are generally contraindicated in carcinoid crises. Carcinoid tumors can secrete catecholamines, and blocking beta-receptors can lead to unopposed alpha-receptor stimulation, resulting in severe hypertension and bronchospasm. Even though this patient is hypotensive, the risk associated with beta-blockers in the context of an active neuroendocrine tumor crisis makes them inappropriate.\n\nD. Intravenous calcium gluconate: This is used for hyperkalemia or calcium channel blocker overdose and has no role in managing carcinoid crisis hypotension.\n\nE. Intravenous methylene blue: Methylene blue is used for refractory vasoplegic shock, particularly when the nitric oxide-guanylate cyclase pathway is implicated (e.g., in sepsis). While the patient has refractory hypotension, octreotide directly targets the specific pathophysiological mechanism of carcinoid syndrome, making it the more specific and appropriate first-line intervention in this scenario.\n\nThe finding of global hypokinesis with apical sparing on TEE (\"takotsubo-like\" pattern) suggests stress-induced cardiomyopathy, which can be precipitated by the severe stress and release of vasoactive mediators during a carcinoid crisis.

The primary goal is to continue providing antidote therapy for acetaminophen toxicity while avoiding the adverse reaction.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Continue NAC at a reduced rate with diphenhydramine premedication: While some protocols suggest premedication with antihistamines and a slower infusion rate for milder NAC reactions, the patient experienced acute respiratory distress, facial edema, and hypotension, which could be considered a significant reaction. Re-challenging with IV NAC, even at a reduced rate, carries a risk of recurrence or exacerbation of a severe anaphylactoid reaction, especially when a safe alternative route exists.\n\nB. Switch to oral NAC 140 mg/kg followed by 70 mg/kg every 4 hours: Oral NAC is an effective route of administration for acetaminophen overdose and is a standard alternative when IV NAC is not tolerated due to hypersensitivity reactions. The oral protocol is well-established and effective in preventing or mitigating hepatotoxicity. Given the anaphylactoid reaction to IV NAC and ongoing liver injury, switching to the oral route is the most appropriate and safest way to ensure continued antidote therapy.\n\nC. Begin high-flux hemodialysis to remove acetaminophen and NAC: Hemodialysis is indicated for acetaminophen poisoning in specific circumstances such as severe metabolic acidosis, renal failure, or hepatic failure. While the patient has elevated AST and a slightly elevated creatinine, the current labs do not unequivocally meet the criteria for hemodialysis as the *primary* next step, especially when continued antidote therapy is paramount.

Right hepatic artery; conversion to laparotomy for repair (B): The right hepatic artery is a major branch of the hepatic artery, which is located in the liver hilum. While its standard anatomical position is usually superior to the common bile duct, anatomical variations exist, and it can be injured in this region, sometimes running posterior to the common bile duct. Brisk arterial bleeding from such a major vessel during laparoscopic surgery, especially with dense adhesions, often necessitates conversion to laparotomy to ensure adequate visualization, control, and potentially complex repair or ligation. This makes option B a strong contender.\n\n2.  Gastroduodenal artery; clip application (D): The gastroduodenal artery (GDA) originates from the common hepatic artery and runs posterior to the first part of the duodenum and the common bile duct before branching. It is a common site of injury in upper abdominal surgery, including procedures near the porta hepatis. Its peculiar anatomical course posterior to the CBD fits the description. Clip application is a standard management for identifiable arterial bleeding. However, for \"brisk arterial bleeding,\" clipping might be technically challenging, unsafe, or insufficient, potentially leading to further complications or requiring conversion to laparotomy.\n\n3.  Replaced right hepatic artery; angiographic embolization (C): Anatomical variations include a replaced right hepatic artery originating from the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and coursing posterior to the portal vein and common bile duct. Injury to such a vessel would be significant. Angiographic embolization is a management option for arterial bleeding, but it is typically performed by interventional radiologists, not as an immediate surgical intervention in the operating room for an emergency bleed unless direct surgical control is impossible or deemed too risky. Therefore, while the vessel is a possibility, the management choice might not be the most appropriate immediate surgical response.\n\n4.  Proper hepatic artery; laparoscopic suture repair (A): Injury to the proper hepatic artery is severe. Laparoscopic suture repair of a briskly bleeding major artery is technically very challenging and often not feasible. Conversion to laparotomy is usually preferred.\n\n5.  Cystic artery stump; electrocautery (E): The cystic artery is usually ligated during cholecystectomy. Bleeding from its stump might occur but is typically less brisk than described, and electrocautery is not always sufficient for significant arterial bleeding. Its location might also not perfectly fit \"near the liver hilum\" in a way that would cause widespread brisk bleeding.\n\nConsidering the severity (\"brisk arterial bleeding\"), location (\"near the liver hilum\"), and the complication of dense adhesions from prior surgery, a conservative approach prioritizing patient safety is crucial. Conversion to laparotomy (B) is a standard and appropriate management for severe, uncontrolled arterial bleeding encountered during laparoscopic surgery, especially from a major vessel supplying the liver like the hepatic artery. While the GDA (D) is also a possibility in the described location, the phrase \"near the liver hilum\" might better describe the hepatic arterial tree, and the management in B reflects the safest course of action for a major vessel injury in that area.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p01-007", "question": "A 72-year-old diabetic man presents with sudden painless vision loss in his right eye to counting fingers.

Immediate anterior chamber paracentesis: This is a temporizing measure to rapidly reduce IOP and may improve visualization, but it is not a definitive management for the underlying cause of glaucoma or the corneal edema.\n\nB. Systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and topical beta-blockers: These are medical treatments used to lower IOP. While essential in the initial management of AACG, they are often insufficient as definitive treatment for severe, established angle closure and do not directly address potential permanent corneal damage.\n\nC. Laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) in the affected eye: LPI is a definitive treatment for anatomical angle closure that results in pupillary block. However, if the cornea is diffusely cloudy, visualization of the iris may be poor, making LPI difficult or impossible to perform effectively. Furthermore, if the lens is the primary cause of angle closure (phacomorphic glaucoma), LPI may not be sufficient.\n\nD. Lens extraction via phacoemulsification: In older patients (like this 72-year-old man), the lens can enlarge and contribute to or cause angle closure (phacomorphic or phacomorphic-phacomorphic glaucoma). Lens extraction is a definitive treatment for such cases, as it removes the mass pushing the iris forward and permanently relieves pupillary block. This would also lower IOP, which may help improve the corneal edema. However, if the corneal endothelium has suffered permanent damage from the prolonged high IOP, lens extraction alone may not restore adequate vision.\n\nE. Endothelial keratoplasty combined with trabeculectomy:\n*   Trabeculectomy: This is a definitive surgical procedure to create a new drainage pathway for aqueous humor, reducing IOP in glaucoma.\n*   Endothelial keratoplasty (EK): This is a definitive surgical procedure to replace the damaged corneal endothelium. The \"diffusely cloudy cornea\" suggests significant endothelial dysfunction, which may be permanent after prolonged severe IOP elevation.\n\nGiven the severity of the presentation (vision to counting fingers, RAPD, severely elevated IOP) and the presence of a \"diffusely cloudy cornea,\" it indicates not only acute angle-closure glaucoma but also significant corneal pathology likely due to compromised endothelial function. While medical management and laser or lens extraction address the glaucoma, the corneal clouding suggests that the cornea itself may require definitive surgical treatment. A combined approach (or staged approach if conditions don't permit immediate combination) involving both glaucoma surgery (trabeculectomy) and corneal surgery (EK) would be the most comprehensive and definitive management to restore vision by addressing both the source of elevated IOP and the corneal opacity caused by it.

He has been on high-dose methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg/day) for 72 hours without improvement. This indicates refractory immune-related adverse events (irAEs).\n\nWhen severe irAEs, particularly life-threatening ones like pneumonitis requiring mechanical ventilation, are refractory to high-dose corticosteroids, escalation of immunosuppression is warranted. Standard second-line treatment options for refractory irAE pneumonitis include plasma exchange (PLEX), infliximab, or mycophenolate mofetil. Cyclophosphamide may be considered for very severe or refractory cases, but is often not the initial second-line agent for pneumonitis.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. Add infliximab 5 mg/kg single dose: Infliximab (a TNF-alpha inhibitor) is a recognized option for refractory irAEs, including pneumonitis, but plasma exchange is often considered a primary next step for severe, refractory cases due to its rapid removal of inflammatory mediators.\nB. Initiate cyclophosphamide 1 g/m² IV: Intravenous cyclophosphamide is a potent immunosuppressant, but it's typically reserved for more severe or specific types of refractory irAEs, or after other second-line agents have failed. It's not usually the first step after steroid failure for pneumonitis.\nC. Switch to dexamethasone 40 mg daily: Dexamethasone is another corticosteroid. Similar to methylprednisolone, it is used as a first-line treatment. Switching to a different corticosteroid without improvement indicates the problem is likely the need for non-corticosteroid immunosuppression, not a different steroid preparation or dose, unless there are specific reasons for the switch not mentioned.\nD. Begin plasma exchange therapy: Plasma exchange is an effective treatment for severe, refractory irAEs, including pneumonitis. It rapidly removes circulating autoantibodies, immune complexes, and inflammatory cytokines, and is often recommended when patients do not respond to initial high-dose corticosteroids. Given the patient is mechanically ventilated, indicating severe disease, plasma exchange would be an appropriate and timely intervention.\nE. Add tocilizumab 8 mg/kg IV: Tocilizumab (an IL-6 receptor antagonist) has a less established role in the management of irAE pneumonitis compared to plasma exchange or infliximab. While IL-6 plays a role in inflammation, the evidence for its targeted inhibition in this specific context is not as robust as for broader immunosuppressive strategies.\n\nConsidering the severity of the presentation (mechanical ventilation) and lack of response to high-dose steroids, plasma exchange is a well-established and effective next step to rapidly address the presumed immune-mediated process in refractory irAE pneumonitis.\n\nThe answer is (D)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p01", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p01-010", "question": "A 70-year-old man with atrial fibrillation on apixaban (non-valvular) presents with acute onset of right-sided weakness and aphasia 4 hours after symptom onset.

Patient Presentation: A 70-year-old man presents with acute stroke symptoms (right-sided weakness, aphasia) 4 hours after onset, consistent with an acute ischemic stroke.\n2.  Diagnosis: CT head shows no hemorrhage, confirming ischemic stroke. CT angiography reveals a left M1 MCA occlusion, indicating a large vessel occlusion (LVO). NIHSS of 15 suggests a moderate to severe stroke.\n3.  Anticoagulation Status: The patient is on apixaban for atrial fibrillation. This is a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) that inhibits Factor Xa.\n4.  Contraindication to IV tPA: The patient is not a candidate for IV tPA (alteplase) due to his current anticoagulation with apixaban. Standard guidelines often exclude patients taking DOACs or with recent anticoagulant use from IV tPA due to increased bleeding risk.\n5.  Treatment Options for LVO: For acute ischemic stroke with LVO in the anterior circulation (like MCA), mechanical thrombectomy is the standard of care, especially within the approved time windows (up to 24 hours in selected patients based on imaging).\n6.  Evaluating the Options:\n    *   A. Administer IV tPA after checking an INR and anti-Xa level: Checking INR is irrelevant for apixaban. While an anti-Xa level can be helpful, it does not by itself remove the contraindication to IV tPA when the patient is actively anticoagulated, unless the level shows negligible effect or is accompanied by reversal. More importantly, the core problem is the LVO which is best treated by thrombectomy.\n    *   B. Proceed directly to mechanical thrombectomy without thrombolysis: This is the most appropriate intervention. Mechanical thrombectomy directly addresses the identified LVO. The presence of apixaban, which contraindicates IV tPA, does not preclude performing mechanical thrombectomy. In fact, mechanical thrombectomy is often the primary treatment for LVO when IV tPA is contraindicated or has failed.\n    *   C. Administer IV protamine to reverse apixaban, then give IV tPA: Protamine sulfate is not the specific reversal agent for apixaban. It is used for heparin and low molecular weight heparin. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n    *   D. Administer andexanet alfa, then give IV tPA: Andexanet alfa is the correct reversal agent for apixaban. This strategy *could* be considered if the goal was to administer both IV tPA and mechanical thrombectomy. However, given the LVO identified on CTA and the contraindication for IV tPA, proceeding directly to the definitive treatment of the occlusion (mechanical thrombectomy) is often the most direct and time-efficient approach, especially since the patient is already within the 4-hour window. If mechanical thrombectomy is available and indicated, it is the priority intervention for LVO.\n    *   E. Initiate IV heparin drip and observe for neurological improvement: Heparin drip is traditionally used for heparin-induced anticoagulation and VTE prophylaxis/treatment, not as an acute treatment for large vessel occlusion stroke. Furthermore, initiating anticoagulation in the acute phase of stroke without addressing the occlusion could be detrimental.\n\n7.  Conclusion: With a confirmed LVO and a contraindication to IV tPA due to anticoagulation, mechanical thrombectomy is the most appropriate and direct acute intervention to restore blood flow to the brain.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."}]
