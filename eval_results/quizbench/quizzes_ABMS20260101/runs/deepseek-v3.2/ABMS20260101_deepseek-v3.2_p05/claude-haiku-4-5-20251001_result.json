TTV reactivation suggests CMV co-infection - While CMV is possible in transplant patients, TTV doesn't specifically indicate CMV. This is speculative.\n\nD.

Hyperphosphatemia (8.2 mg/dL) - This would worsen hypocalcemia but wouldn't specifically prevent calcium therapy from working\n\nC. Metabolic alkalosis (pH 7.48) - Alkalosis increases protein binding of calcium, reducing ionized calcium, but this is already measured as ionized calcium (0.8 mmol/L), so this is accounted for\n\nD.
