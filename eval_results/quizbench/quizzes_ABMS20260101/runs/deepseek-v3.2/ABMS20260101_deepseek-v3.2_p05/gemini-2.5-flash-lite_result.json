The CT angiography ruled out mesenteric ischemia. The gastric emptying study was normal. Upper endoscopy with duodenal biopsies showed villous blunting and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes. Crucially, a serum tryptase level measured during an episode was 45 ng/mL, which is significantly elevated above the normal range (<11.4 ng/mL).\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Mesenteric venous thrombosis with portal hypertensive enteropathy: While portal venous issues can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, the marked elevation in serum tryptase is not explained by this diagnosis. CT angiography ruling out mesenteric ischemia makes arterial compression less likely, and while venous issues are harder to assess on standard CT angio, this option doesn't account for the tryptase.\n\nB. Systemic mastocytosis with gastrointestinal involvement: Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is characterized by the abnormal proliferation and accumulation of mast cells. Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in SM and can include abdominal pain, cramping, diarrhea, nausea, and malabsorption. Importantly, mast cell degranulation releases mediators (like histamine, tryptase, etc.) that can cause these symptoms. A significantly elevated serum tryptase level, especially when measured during a symptomatic episode, is a key diagnostic criterion for SM. The value of 45 ng/mL is highly suggestive of mast cell activation. Duodenal biopsies in SM can show increased numbers of mast cells, which can lead to villous blunting and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes, sometimes mimicking celiac disease. The post-prandial nature of symptoms and improvement with fasting are also compatible with mast cell activation triggered by food intake.\n\nC. Celiac disease with refractory sprue: The duodenal biopsy findings (villous blunting, increased intraepithelial lymphocytes) are classic for celiac disease. However, celiac disease itself does not cause elevated serum tryptase levels. While some patients with celiac disease might have incidental findings or co-existing conditions, a profound elevation of tryptase during an episode strongly points away from uncomplicated celiac disease as the sole or primary diagnosis. Refractory sprue implies unresponsiveness to a gluten-free diet, but the elevated tryptase is the overriding factor here.\n\nD. Abdominal angina from median arcuate ligament syndrome: This condition causes chronic mesenteric ischemia due to compression of the celiac artery. Symptoms are typically post-prandial pain. However, the CT angiography showed \"no mesenteric ischemia,\" which generally implies no significant arterial compromise was detected. More importantly, MALS does not involve mast cell activation or cause elevated tryptase levels.\n\nE. Bile acid malabsorption due to ileal dysfunction: Bile acid malabsorption can cause diarrhea, particularly post-prandial diarrhea. However, severe cramping pain 30-60 minutes after meals is not the most typical presentation. Most importantly, this condition does not explain the markedly elevated serum tryptase.\n\nThe most striking and differentiating finding in this case is the significantly elevated serum tryptase level (45 ng/mL) measured during an episode of symptoms. This strongly supports a diagnosis involving mast cell activation. Systemic mastocytosis with gastrointestinal involvement is the condition that best explains all the presented findings, including the symptoms, the elevated tryptase, and the duodenal biopsy results (which can be seen in SM).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p05", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p05-002", "question": "A 29-year-old woman presents with 6 months of progressive dyspnea and palpitations.

This constellation of findings strongly suggests Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH).\n\nThe question asks for the definitive diagnostic test. CTEPH is diagnosed by demonstrating persistent obstruction of the pulmonary arteries by organized thromboemboli. Both pulmonary angiography (A) and CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) (B) are imaging modalities used to visualize the pulmonary vasculature and identify such obstructions.\n\nTraditionally, conventional pulmonary angiography has been considered the gold standard for diagnosing pulmonary embolism, including CTEPH, due to its high resolution and ability to provide detailed anatomical information about the pulmonary arteries. It is particularly useful for assessing the extent and character of chronic thromboembolic disease, which is crucial for surgical planning.\n\nCTPA has become a widely used and highly accurate non-invasive test for diagnosing PE and CTEPH. In many cases, CTPA can definitively identify thromboembolic obstructions and guide management. However, in situations where CTPA findings are equivocal, or when highly detailed anatomical assessment is required for surgical or interventional planning, conventional pulmonary angiography may still be performed.\n\nConsidering the options, and that \"definitive diagnostic test\" often refers to the gold standard, especially when there are subtle nuances in diagnostic certainty or detail, conventional pulmonary angiography (A) is a strong contender. The HRCT described likely refers to a standard HRCT of the lung parenchyma, not a CTPA specific for pulmonary arteries. Thus, a dedicated imaging of the pulmonary arteries is needed. Between A and B, while CTPA is commonly used and often sufficient, conventional angiography historically holds the status of the most definitive diagnostic test for visualizing pulmonary vascular obstruction.\n\nOptions C, D, and E are not the primary definitive diagnostic tests for CTEPH based on the given clinical presentation. Genetic testing (C) is for heritable PAH. Lung biopsy (D) is rarely indicated for PH diagnosis. Exercise right heart catheterization (E) is used to assess exercise-induced PH.\n\nGiven that pulmonary angiography is widely cited as the gold standard for definitive diagnosis and detailed anatomical assessment in CTEPH, and it is offered as an option, it is the most appropriate choice for the \"definitive diagnostic test.\"\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p05", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p05-003", "question": "A 67-year-old man who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation 4 months ago for HCV cirrhosis presents with fever, cough, and hypoxemia.

The bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) PCR is positive for Torque teno virus (TTV) DNA at a high viral load (10^8 copies/mL), and the blood TTV viral load is also high (10^7 copies/mL).\n\nTTV is a ubiquitous virus that infects most individuals. In immunocompromised patients, particularly solid organ transplant recipients, TTV can replicate to high levels. While its precise pathogenic role in causing disease is still being elucidated and debated, high viral loads, especially in specific anatomical sites like the lungs, are often associated with clinical manifestations and adverse outcomes. These high viral loads are widely considered to be an indicator of significant immunosuppression.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\nA. TTV indicates severe immunosuppression; reduce tacrolimus dose and monitor for resolution. High TTV viral load in a transplant recipient is a marker for the intensity of immunosuppression. Reducing immunosuppression is a standard strategy to allow the host immune system to regain control over viral replication and potentially resolve the clinical illness. This option aligns with the current understanding of TTV's significance in immunocompromised hosts.\n\nB. TTV is a direct pulmonary pathogen; initiate intravenous ribavirin therapy. The role of TTV as a direct pulmonary pathogen is not definitively established, and its treatment outcomes with ribavirin are not well-documented or considered standard therapy. Management primarily focuses on modulating immunosuppression.\n\nC. TTV reactivation suggests CMV co-infection; start ganciclovir empirically. While CMV co-infection is a significant concern in transplant recipients and can present similarly, the provided information only indicates TTV positivity. There is no mention of CMV detection. Empiric ganciclovir should not be initiated solely based on TTV findings without any evidence of CMV.\n\nD. TTV viral load has no clinical significance in this setting; pursue alternative diagnoses. Given the high viral load in BAL fluid and blood, coupled with the patient's symptoms and CT findings, it is premature to dismiss TTV's potential clinical significance, even if its exact role is complex. It strongly suggests a state of immune dysregulation.\n\nE. TTV indicates possible donor-derived infection; perform lung biopsy for histopathology. TTV can indeed be transmitted via organ transplantation. However, the immediate management decision relates to the current clinical presentation. While a lung biopsy is an option for undiagnosed pulmonary infiltrates, it is an invasive procedure and not typically the first step when a significant viral load detected by PCR is already identified and points towards management related to immunosuppression.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate interpretation and management is to recognize that the high TTV viral load reflects significant immunosuppression and to reduce immunosuppressive therapy.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p05", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p05-004", "question": "A 4-year-old boy with DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion) develops pneumonia requiring hospitalization.

This is consistent with undetectable parathyroid hormone (PTH) and hypocalcemia. The hypocalcemia is described as refractory to therapy, meaning IV calcium gluconate is not effectively raising the ionized calcium level. The ECG showing a prolonged QTc interval is a classic sign of hypocalcemia.\n\nWe need to identify which electrolyte abnormality most likely explains why the hypocalcemia is refractory to treatment. Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Hypomagnesemia (0.9 mg/dL): Normal serum magnesium levels are typically between 1.7-2.2 mg/dL (0.7-0.9 mmol/L). A level of 0.9 mg/dL is at the lower end of normal or suggest mild hypomagnesemia depending on the lab reference range. However, it is known that magnesium is crucial for PTH secretion and for the action of PTH at its target tissues (bone and kidney). Severe hypomagnesemia can lead to functional hypoparathyroidism and resistance to PTH, making calcium levels unresponsive to standard treatment. If magnesium levels are critically low, the body cannot effectively respond to calcium supplementation or utilize available PTH (even if it were present). Correcting hypomagnesemia often resolves refractory hypocalcemia.\n\nB. Hyperphosphatemia (8.2 mg/dL): Normal serum phosphate levels in children are typically 2.5-4.5 mg/dL. Hyperphosphatemia (8.2 mg/dL) is expected in hypoparathyroidism because PTH normally promotes phosphate excretion by the kidneys. High phosphate can bind with calcium, leading to low ionized calcium levels. However, hyperphosphatemia itself does not typically make hypocalcemia refractory to IV calcium. IV calcium administration directly compensates for the low ionized calcium. Persistent hyperphosphatemia requires management (e.g., phosphate binders), but it doesn't prevent IV calcium from raising serum calcium levels, at least acutely.\n\nC. Metabolic alkalosis (pH 7.48): A pH of 7.48 indicates mild alkalosis. Alkalosis increases the binding of calcium to albumin, which reduces the level of ionized calcium. This can unmask or exacerbate hypocalcemia. However, similar to hyperphosphatemia, metabolic alkalosis does not make the hypocalcemia refractory to IV calcium administration. IV calcium directly increases the ionized calcium pool.\n\nD. Hyperkalemia (6.2 mEq/L): Normal serum potassium is 3.5-5.0 mEq/L. Hyperkalemia (6.2 mEq/L) is not a direct cause of refractory hypocalcemia. While PTH can play a minor role in potassium regulation, and kidney function can affect both electrolytes, hyperkalemia itself doesn't explain resistance to calcium therapy.\n\nE. Hyponatremia (125 mEq/L): Normal serum sodium is 135-145 mEq/L. Hyponatremia (125 mEq/L) can be caused by various factors (SIADH, salt wasting, etc.) but does not directly cause refractory hypocalcemia.\n\nConsidering the options, hypomagnesemia is the most common and significant cause of hypocalcemia that is refractory to calcium therapy. Low magnesium impairs the body's ability to respond to and utilize PTH, leading to persistent low calcium levels despite calcium supplementation. The given magnesium value of 0.9 mg/dL is low and likely contributes to the refractory hypocalcemia.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p05", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p05-005", "question": "A 28-year-old male presents to the ED with 2 hours of severe, tearing interscapular back pain radiating to the left flank.

Administer IV labetalol to target systolic BP <120 mmHg. Labetalol is an alpha and beta-blocker, useful for BP control.

Obtain an emergent CT angiogram of the chest/abdomen/pelvis. This is crucial for diagnosis and defining the extent of the dissection, and it is a necessary step.

Start an IV esmolol infusion to target heart rate <60 bpm and systolic BP <120 mmHg.

Digoxin 0.125 mg daily: Digoxin is sometimes used in heart failure to improve symptoms. While it crosses the placenta, it is generally considered to be of relatively low risk in pregnancy and can be used cautiously if indicated for symptom control. It is not typically a medication that must be avoided until after delivery.\n\nB.  Hydralazine 25 mg three times daily: Hydralazine is a vasodilator. It can be used to manage hypertension in pregnancy and is also considered for heart failure management. It is generally considered safe to use in pregnancy.\n\nC.  Isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg three times daily: Isosorbide dinitrate is a nitrate, which is a vasodilator. Nitrates are generally considered safe for use in pregnancy for cardiovascular conditions, although their hemodynamic effects require careful monitoring. It is not typically a medication that must be avoided until after delivery.\n\nD.  Sacubitril/valsartan 24/26 mg twice daily: This medication is an Angiotensin Receptor-Neprilysin Inhibitor (ARNI). It contains valsartan, which is an Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker (ARB). ARBs, along with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs), are known to cause fetal injury or death when administered during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. These drugs can cause oligohydramnios, a condition of low amniotic fluid volume, which leads to fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal abnormalities including skull hypoplasia. For these reasons, ARBs and ACEIs (and therefore ARNIs) are contraindicated in pregnant women, especially in the second and third trimesters. This medication *must* be avoided until after delivery. The FDA has a boxed warning against the use of ARBs in pregnancy.\n\nE.  Metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily: Beta-blockers, such as metoprolol, are considered a mainstay in the treatment of heart failure, including PPCM. While beta-blockers carry certain risks in pregnancy (e.g., intrauterine growth restriction, prematurity, neonatal bradycardia), they are generally considered safe and beneficial when indicated for maternal cardiac conditions. Specific beta-blockers like metoprolol and carvedilol are often continued or initiated in PPCM during pregnancy. They are not avoided until after delivery.\n\nTherefore, Sacubitril/valsartan is the medication that should be avoided until after delivery due to the contraindication of ARBs in pregnancy.\n\nThe answer is (D)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p05", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p05-007", "question": "A 19-year-old male with a history of autism spectrum disorder (level 1) is admitted to the inpatient psychiatry unit after he threatened his parents with a knife.

Elevated Creatine Kinase: Significantly elevated at 5,000 U/L, indicating muscle breakdown.\nThese symptoms, occurring within 72 hours of starting risperidone, strongly point to NMS.\n\nThe management of NMS involves several crucial steps, prioritized as follows:\n1.

Supportive care: This includes hydration, fever reduction (cooling measures), monitoring of vital signs, and management of complications.\n3.

However, it is typically administered after the offending agent has been discontinued and supportive care has been initiated, or in severe cases concurrently. It is not the absolute first step.\nC. Administer intravenous bromocriptine: Bromocriptine is another potential treatment for NMS. Similar to dantrolene, it is considered after stopping the offending medication.\nD. Discontinue risperidone immediately and provide supportive care: This option encompasses the two most important and immediate steps in managing suspected NMS: stopping the causative medication and providing essential supportive measures.

This requires identifying evidence for a metabolic cause that explains the findings.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Metaphyseal corner fractures on skeletal survey: These fractures are highly specific for non-accidental trauma and would therefore *support* trauma, not GA1.\n\nB. Elevated serum ammonia level: While some inborn errors of metabolism can cause elevated ammonia, it is not a specific or prominent feature of GA1 and can be seen in other conditions, including severe illness from any cause. It does not strongly differentiate GA1 from trauma.\n\nC. Frontotemporal atrophy with widened Sylvian fissures on MRI: This is a characteristic neuroimaging finding in GA1. This atrophy can lead to subdural hygromas, which can rupture or be misinterpreted as traumatic subdural hematomas. This finding strongly suggests GA1 and provides a potential non-traumatic explanation for the observed subdural hematomas, thus supporting GA1 over trauma as an explanation.\n\nD. Subarachnoid hemorrhage extending into the posterior fossa: Subarachnoid hemorrhage can occur in both non-accidental trauma and, less commonly, in metabolic disorders. This finding is not specific enough to strongly differentiate between the two.\n\nE. Elevated urine organic acids showing 3-hydroxyglutaric aciduria: Glutaric aciduria type 1 is characterized by the accumulation of glutaric acid and 3-hydroxyglutaric acid. Detecting elevated 3-hydroxyglutaric acid in urine is the definitive biochemical diagnostic test for GA1. Confirming the diagnosis of GA1 through this test would provide the strongest support for the presence of this metabolic disorder. Once GA1 is confirmed, the observed subdural hematomas would be interpreted in the context of this disorder, strongly arguing against non-accidental trauma as the sole or primary explanation.\n\nComparing options C and E:\nOption C (characteristic MRI pattern) is highly suggestive of GA1 and offers a mechanistic explanation for the subdural hematomas.\nOption E (elevated urine organic acids) is the definitive diagnostic test for GA1. In distinguishing between two diagnoses, definitive confirmation of one diagnosis (GA1) is generally considered stronger evidence than suggestive imaging findings alone, as it directly establishes the presence of the disorder in question.

DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion) is associated with T-cell deficiencies due to thymic hypoplasia or aplasia. Live viral vaccines are contraindicated in immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with severe T-cell immunodeficiency.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\nA. CD4+ T cell count <500 cells/μL: While a low CD4 count indicates T-cell deficiency, the threshold for an absolute contraindication to live viral vaccines depends on the specific vaccine and the overall immune status. For example, in HIV infection, CD4 counts below 200 cells/μL are typically considered a contraindication. A count of <500 cells/μL might be a relative contraindication or a reason for caution, but not necessarily an absolute one for all situations.\n\nB. Absent thymic shadow on chest radiograph: The thymus is crucial for T-cell development. An absent thymic shadow indicates thymic aplasia or severe hypoplasia, strongly suggesting T-cell deficiency in DiGeorge syndrome. However, this is an imaging finding and not a direct measure of immune function or cellularity. Some individuals with absent thymic shadow may still have detectable T cells.\n\nC. Low but detectable T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs): TRECs are markers of recent thymic emigrants, reflecting the output of newly generated T cells from the thymus. Low but detectable TRECs indicate impaired T-cell production but imply that some T cells are still being generated and emigrating. This suggests a degree of immune competence, making it less likely to be an absolute contraindication compared to more severe deficiencies.\n\nD. Severely reduced proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA): PHA is a mitogen that stimulates T-cell proliferation. A severely reduced proliferative response indicates significant functional impairment of T cells. This is a strong indicator of cellular immunodeficiency and would make live viral vaccines dangerous, as the immune system would be unable to control the attenuated virus. This represents severe T-cell immunodeficiency.\n\nE. Complete absence of CD3+ T cells by flow cytometry: CD3 is a pan-T cell marker. Complete absence of CD3+ T cells signifies T-cell aplasia, which is a form of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). SCID, characterized by a profound lack of T-cell immunity, is universally considered an absolute contraindication for live viral vaccines because the immune system cannot mount an adequate defense against the attenuated pathogen, leading to uncontrolled viral replication and severe, potentially fatal, illness.\n\nComparing options D and E, both represent severe T-cell immunodeficiency where live viral vaccines are contraindicated. However, complete absence of CD3+ T cells (E) represents the most profound and quantitative defect of the T-cell system, a state analogous to SCID. This is a more definitive and absolute contraindication than a severely reduced functional response, as it signifies the complete lack of the major cellular arm responsible for controlling viral infections. In practical terms, if there are no T cells, the body cannot control the live virus, leading to severe disseminated disease.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{E}$."}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p05", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p05-010", "question": "A neonate born at 32 weeks gestation develops necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) on day 10 of life.

A high jejunostomy implies diverting the fecal stream from the proximal small bowel. This is typically done when there is insufficient healthy bowel in the proximal region or the distal region to perform a safe primary anastomosis, or when the patient's condition is too unstable.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\nA. Involvement of the ileocecal valve: If the ileocecal valve and terminal ileum are necrotic, this compromises the distal end of the small bowel. While it might necessitate an ileostomy rather than a primary ileocecal anastomosis, it doesn't automatically mandate a *high jejunostomy* over any form of primary bowel anastomosis if healthy proximal jejunum can be anastomosed to the colon.\nB. Necrosis extending to within 5 cm of the ligament of Treitz: The ligament of Treitz marks the junction between the duodenum and the jejunum. If the necrotic process extends this proximally, it means a very significant portion of the proximal jejunum is involved and likely non-viable. Resection of such a large segment leaves a critically short proximal jejunal limb. Performing a primary anastomosis between a very short proximal jejunal segment and the distal bowel is often impossible or extremely risky due to tension, poor blood supply, and increased risk of anastomotic leak, especially in a premature infant. In such a scenario, the safest management is to exteriorize the remaining proximal jejunum as a high jejunostomy. This directly mandates avoiding primary anastomosis and opting for diversion.\nC. Presence of pneumatosis intestinalis in the remaining bowel: Pneumatosis intestinalis indicates ongoing or severe bowel wall compromise. Its presence makes primary anastomosis risky due to the friability of the bowel and increased risk of leak. However, it doesn't inherently \"mandate\" avoiding primary anastomosis altogether if there are relatively healthy segments available and the surgeon deems the risk acceptable. It is a significant concern that might lead to stoma creation, but perhaps not as absolute a mandate as a critical loss of proximal bowel length.\nD. Concurrent isolated perforation of the gastric fundus: Gastric perforation is a separate pathological process from small bowel NEC. The management of gastric perforation does not directly dictate the decision to perform a primary anastomosis versus a jejunostomy for the small bowel NEC itself.\nE. Development of abdominal compartment syndrome during surgery: Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) suggests severe intra-abdominal insult and increased pressure. Management often involves reducing the pressure, which can include leaving the abdomen open or exteriorizing bowel. While it might lead to abandonment of a primary anastomosis and creation of stomas for decompression and staged reconstruction, it is a consequence of the overall precarious state and doesn't specifically point to a *high jejunostomy* as the mandated alternative over all other primary anastomosis possibilities based on bowel viability alone.\n\nOption B describes a situation where the anatomical feasibility of a primary anastomosis is severely compromised by the loss of essential proximal bowel length. This is a strong indication for diversion via stoma.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."}]
