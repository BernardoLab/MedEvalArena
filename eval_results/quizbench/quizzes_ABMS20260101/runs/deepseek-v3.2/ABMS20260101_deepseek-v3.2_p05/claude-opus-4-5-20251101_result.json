Mesenteric venous thrombosis with portal hypertensive enteropathy - CT angiography was negative for mesenteric ischemia, making this unlikely.\n\nB. Systemic mastocytosis with gastrointestinal involvement - The markedly elevated serum tryptase (45 ng/mL, nearly 4x normal) is highly suggestive of mast cell activation/mastocytosis. Systemic mastocytosis can cause GI symptoms including cramping, diarrhea, and can show villous blunting on biopsy. The postprandial timing and improvement with fasting fits mast cell degranulation triggered by food.\n\nC. Celiac disease with refractory sprue - While villous blunting and intraepithelial lymphocytes are classic for celiac disease, the significantly elevated tryptase is NOT a feature of celiac disease. This finding points away from celiac as the primary diagnosis.\n\nD. Abdominal angina from median arcuate ligament syndrome - CT angiography showed no mesenteric ischemia, and this wouldn't explain the elevated tryptase.\n\nE. Bile acid malabsorption due to ileal dysfunction - While possible given her liver disease and ursodeoxycholic acid use, this wouldn't explain the elevated tryptase or the duodenal biopsy findings.\n\nCritical Finding: The elevated serum tryptase during an episode is the key discriminating feature. Tryptase is released by mast cells, and levels >20 ng/mL strongly suggest systemic mastocytosis. The GI symptoms (postprandial pain, diarrhea) and histologic findings (villous changes, which can occur in mastocytosis due to mast cell infiltration) are consistent with GI involvement of systemic mastocytosis.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p05", "question_id": "ABMS20260101_deepseek-v3.2_p05-002", "question": "A 29-year-old woman presents with 6 months of progressive dyspnea and palpitations.

High TTV loads (>10^7) suggest over-immunosuppression. However, simply reducing immunosuppression without treating the underlying infection would be incomplete.\n\nB.

TTV has no clinical significance; pursue alternative diagnoses - This is the most appropriate answer. While TTV may serve as a biomarker, the immediate clinical priority is identifying the actual pathogen causing the pulmonary disease. The halo sign strongly suggests invasive aspergillosis, which requires urgent diagnosis and treatment. TTV itself is not causing the pneumonia.\n\nE. Donor-derived infection requiring biopsy - TTV is ubiquitous and not typically considered in donor-derived infection workups.\n\nThe key point is that TTV is not the cause of this patient's pulmonary disease.

Hypomagnesemia (0.9 mg/dL) - Normal magnesium is 1.7-2.2 mg/dL. This is severely low. Magnesium is critical for:\n1. PTH secretion from parathyroid glands\n2. PTH action at target tissues\n3. Proper calcium homeostasis\n\nHypomagnesemia causes functional hypoparathyroidism and makes hypocalcemia refractory to calcium replacement. You cannot correct hypocalcemia without first correcting magnesium deficiency.\n\nB. Hyperphosphatemia (8.2 mg/dL) - While hyperphosphatemia can contribute to hypocalcemia through calcium-phosphate precipitation, it doesn't typically cause complete refractoriness to IV calcium therapy. The patient already has hypoparathyroidism which would cause some hyperphosphatemia.\n\nC. Metabolic alkalosis (pH 7.48) - Alkalosis increases calcium binding to albumin, decreasing ionized calcium. However, the question states ionized calcium is 0.8 mmol/L, which is already the measured ionized (free) calcium, so alkalosis wouldn't explain the refractory nature.\n\nD. Hyperkalemia (6.2 mEq/L) - Hyperkalemia doesn't directly cause refractory hypocalcemia. In fact, calcium is often given to treat hyperkalemia.\n\nE. Hyponatremia (125 mEq/L) - Hyponatremia doesn't directly affect calcium metabolism or cause refractory hypocalcemia.\n\nThe classic teaching is that hypomagnesemia causes refractory hypocalcemia because magnesium is essential for both PTH release and PTH action on target organs.

Frontotemporal atrophy with widened Sylvian fissures on MRI - This is a CLASSIC finding in GA-1. The characteristic \"bat-wing\" appearance of widened Sylvian fissures and frontotemporal hypoplasia/atrophy is pathognomonic.
