Younger age at onset (particularly <3 years) is paradoxically associated with worse long-term cognitive and behavioral outcomes, likely due to the impact of neuroinflammation on the developing brain during critical periods. While MYCN amplification indicates aggressive tumor biology, it does not correlate with neurological outcomes. Anti-Hu antibodies are rare in pediatric OMS. CSF inflammatory markers and treatment delays affect outcomes but age remains the strongest predictor of neurodevelopmental sequelae.", "generator_model": "claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "seed": 125, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "pred": "C", "model_outputs": "To answer this question, I need to analyze the case of opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome (OMS) associated with neuroblastoma and determine which factor indicates the worst long-term neurodevelopmental prognosis.\n\nThe patient has classic OMS with:\n- Opsoclonus (chaotic eye movements)\n- Myoclonus\n- Truncal ataxia\n- Paraspinal mass\n- Elevated urine catecholamines\n- Likely neuroblastoma\n\nAnalyzing each option:\n\nA. Anti-Hu antibodies: These paraneoplastic antibodies are associated with neurological syndromes but are not the strongest predictor of poor neurodevelopmental outcomes in pediatric OMS.\n\nB. CSF oligoclonal bands/elevated IgG: These indicate CNS inflammation but aren't the strongest predictor of poor neurodevelopmental outcomes in OMS.\n\nC. Age less than 3 years: Younger age at onset is associated with worse neurodevelopmental outcomes in OMS, as the developing brain is more vulnerable to immune-mediated injury.\n\nD. MYCN amplification: This is a genetic marker of aggressive neuroblastoma associated with poor tumor prognosis, but doesn't necessarily predict worse neurodevelopmental outcomes compared to other factors.\n\nE. Delayed immunotherapy: While early immunotherapy is beneficial, a 4-week delay isn't the strongest predictor of poor neurodevelopmental outcomes compared to other factors.\n\nBased on the literature, younger age at onset (option C) is consistently associated with worse long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes in OMS, as the developing brain is particularly vulnerable to immune-mediated injury during critical developmental periods.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}]
