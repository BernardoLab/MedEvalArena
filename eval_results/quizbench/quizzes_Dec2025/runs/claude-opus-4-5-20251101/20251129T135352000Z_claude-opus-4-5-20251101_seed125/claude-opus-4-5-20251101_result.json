Residual maternal IgG providing passive immunity - Maternal IgG crosses the placenta and provides protection to infants. It has a half-life of about 21-28 days and typically wanes by 6-9 months of age. At 2 years old, maternal antibodies would be completely gone. This doesn't explain the asymptomatic state.\n\nB. Somatic mosaicism with partial gene function restoration - If the brother has the \"same mutation,\" this implies identical genetic testing results. Somatic mosaicism would show different results.\n\nC. Compensatory upregulation of alternative signaling pathways - There's no known compensatory mechanism that can bypass BTK deficiency in B cell development.\n\nD. X-chromosome inactivation favoring the wild-type allele - This applies to females who are heterozygous carriers. Males have only one X chromosome, so there's no alternative allele to favor.\n\nE. Presence of a hypomorphic rather than null mutation - The question states they have the \"same mutation,\" so this wouldn't explain the difference between the brothers.\n\nWait - reconsidering option A: At 2 years old, maternal antibodies are gone. However, the key insight is that XLA patients typically become symptomatic after 6-9 months when maternal antibodies wane. But some children may have delayed onset of infections depending on exposure and other factors.\n\nActually, looking more carefully - at age 2, maternal IgG would definitely be gone (it's cleared by 6-12 months). The brother being asymptomatic at 2 years with the same null mutation is unusual.\n\nThe most likely explanation given the options would be B - Somatic mosaicism - where some cells have reverted or there's mosaicism allowing partial B cell development, even if the germline mutation is the same.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed125", "question_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed125-002", "question": "A 58-year-old woman with metastatic melanoma receiving combination ipilimumab and nivolumab develops acute onset confusion, fever to 39.2°C, and neck stiffness on day 21 of treatment.

Markedly elevated CSF IL-17 levels - IL-17 is associated with Th17 responses, seen in various autoimmune conditions, but not specifically characteristic of ICI-induced meningitis.\n\nD. CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio greater than 4:1 with activated phenotype - This is highly relevant. ICI therapy, particularly anti-CTLA-4 (ipilimumab), works by enhancing T cell activation, especially CD4+ T cells.

Dobutamine - The heart is already hyperdynamic with EF 70%. Adding inotropes to an already well-contracting but underfilled heart won't help and could worsen tachycardia.\n\nB. Additional crystalloid - The underfilled chambers suggest more preload is needed. This would increase stroke volume and cardiac output, improving oxygen delivery and potentially MAP.\n\nC. Phenylephrine - Pure vasoconstrictor that can decrease cardiac output. Not ideal when CI is already low.\n\nD. Epinephrine - Could be considered as a third vasopressor, but the primary issue appears to be inadequate preload, not vasopressor failure.\n\nE. Hydrocortisone - Indicated for refractory septic shock, but the Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends this when shock is refractory to fluids AND vasopressors. The echo suggests the patient may still be fluid-responsive.\n\nConclusion:\nThe echocardiogram showing small, underfilled chambers with hyperdynamic function strongly suggests the patient needs more volume. Despite initial \"adequate\" resuscitation, the echo evidence indicates ongoing hypovolemia. The low ScvO2 and low cardiac index support inadequate oxygen delivery that would improve with increased preload.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed125", "question_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed125-010", "question": "A 7-year-old boy presents with 2 weeks of progressive gait instability and tremor.

Anti-Hu antibodies: These are associated with paraneoplastic syndromes but are more commonly seen in adults with small cell lung cancer. In pediatric OMS, anti-Hu is not the primary predictor of neurodevelopmental outcome.\n\nB. CSF oligoclonal bands with elevated IgG index: This indicates intrathecal antibody synthesis and CNS inflammation. While it confirms immune-mediated pathology, it's actually expected in OMS and doesn't necessarily predict worse outcomes.\n\nC. Age less than 3 years at symptom onset: This is a well-established poor prognostic factor for neurodevelopmental outcomes in OMS. Younger children have developing brains that are more vulnerable to immune-mediated injury. Studies consistently show that younger age at onset correlates with worse cognitive and developmental outcomes, including learning disabilities, behavioral problems, and motor deficits.\n\nD. MYCN amplification: This is a poor prognostic factor for TUMOR survival/oncologic outcome, but interestingly, patients with OMS-associated neuroblastoma typically have favorable tumor biology (often without MYCN amplification). The neurological prognosis in OMS is largely independent of tumor biology - it's the immune-mediated CNS damage that determines neurodevelopmental outcomes.\n\nE. Delayed immunotherapy: While early treatment is important, the question asks about the WORST prognosis indicator. Delay is modifiable and doesn't inherently predict the worst outcomes compared to age.\n\nThe key distinction is that younger age at onset (particularly <3 years) is consistently the strongest predictor of poor long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes in OMS, as the developing brain is more susceptible to permanent immune-mediated damage.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}]
