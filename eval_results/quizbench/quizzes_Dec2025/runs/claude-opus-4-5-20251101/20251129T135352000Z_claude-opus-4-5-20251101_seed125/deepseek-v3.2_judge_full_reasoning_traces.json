The vignette describes classic X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) due to a BTK mutation, with absent B cells and immunoglobulins. The asymptomatic 2-year-old brother has the same mutation. While residual maternal IgG (A) is a possible explanation, it is highly unlikely to provide protection until age 2, as it typically wanes by 6-9 months. The most plausible and best-supported explanation is a hypomorphic mutation (E), which can cause a milder, later-onset phenotype, consistent with preserved genetic testing but variable clinical expressivity. Options B, C, and D are less likely given the provided lab findings. The main logical issue is the key mismatch. Minimal fix: Change the correct answer key to E.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n    \"logical_validity\": false,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n

Key stem clues: patient on ipilimumab/nivolumab with acute meningitis symptoms, lymphocytic pleocytosis, negative cytology/flow, and leptomeningeal enhancement. The question asks for the CSF finding that most strongly supports immune-related meningitis over infectious/neoplastic causes. The keyed answer (D) describes a CD4+/CD8+ ratio >4:1 with activated phenotype. However, while immune-related meningitis can show a lymphocytic predominance, a CD4+ predominance with a specific high ratio is not a well-established, pathognomonic diagnostic criterion for this toxicity over other lymphocytic meningitides (e.g., viral, autoimmune). The most specific finding to support an immune-mediated, treatment-related etiology in this context is the presence of matched oligoclonal bands in CSF and serum (B), which is a recognized biomarker of systemic immune activation seen in checkpoint inhibitor-related neurologic toxicities. Option D is not uniquely diagnostic. Main logical issue: a unique best answer exists, but the provided key is not it. Minimal fix: Change the key to B and adjust the rationale to highlight matched oligoclonal bands as a marker of systemic immune activation from checkpoint inhibitors.\",\n  \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n  \"logical_validity\": false,\n  \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n  \"3\"\n}",

The stem asks for the finding indicating the WORST long-term neurodevelopmental prognosis in OMS associated with neuroblastoma. While age <3 years is a known risk factor for worse neurodevelopmental outcomes, option E (delayed initiation of immunotherapy beyond 4 weeks) is a well-established, modifiable predictor of poor neurological outcome in OMS, often emphasized as critical in management guidelines. The provided rationale incorrectly minimizes this. The stem does not contain internal contradictions (C) or make multiple options equally defensible (M), as a unique best answer exists, but the provided key is not it. Minimal fix: Change the key to E and adjust the rationale to reflect that treatment delay is a major, independent prognostic factor for neurodevelopmental outcome.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n    \"logical_validity\": false,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \"3\"\n}",
