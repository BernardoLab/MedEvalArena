Echocardiography reveals a resting left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient of 85 mmHg, systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve, and septal thickness of 22 mm. Coronary angiography shows a large first septal perforator arising from the left anterior descending artery supplying the basal septum. She is referred for alcohol septal ablation.

Antibody-mediated accelerated insulin clearance causing initial hyperglycemia followed by rebound hypoglycemia\n- Accelerated clearance would reduce insulin action, causing hyperglycemia, but wouldn't explain the subsequent severe hypoglycemia through this mechanism alone.\n\nB. Antibody buffering of exogenous insulin with delayed release causing prolonged insulin action\n- This is the classic mechanism in insulin antibody syndrome. Antibodies bind insulin after injection/bolus, creating a \"reservoir.\" This initially reduces free insulin availability (allowing glucose to rise to 180 mg/dL). Then, as antibodies release insulin in an unregulated fashion, there's a delayed surge of free insulin causing hypoglycemia. The timing (3-4 hours postprandially) fits this buffering and delayed release pattern.\n\nC. Cross-reactivity of anti-insulin antibodies with insulin receptors causing receptor activation\n- Anti-insulin antibodies bind insulin, not insulin receptors. This would describe anti-insulin receptor antibodies (Type B insulin resistance), which is a different condition.\n\nD. Antibody-induced insulin resistance requiring higher doses with subsequent overdosing\n- While insulin antibodies can cause resistance, the pattern described (rapid drops after initial highs) doesn't fit simple overdosing, which would cause more immediate hypoglycemia.\n\nE. Complement-mediated destruction of pancreatic alpha cells reducing glucagon counterregulation\n- This is not a recognized mechanism of anti-insulin antibodies.\n\nThe classic mechanism of insulin antibody syndrome involves antibodies acting as a buffer - binding insulin and then releasing it unpredictably, causing delayed hypoglycemia.

This means there's already some LV pre-excitation built into the system, but we need to consider if this is optimal.\n\nAnalyzing Options:\n\nA. Shortening AV delay - This would ensure more consistent biventricular pacing capture (preventing fusion with intrinsic conduction), but doesn't address the VV timing issue directly.\n\nB. Lengthening AV delay - This could allow more intrinsic conduction, which would worsen synchrony given the 40 ms LV delay during intrinsic conduction.\n\nC. RV preceding LV by 40 ms - This would make LV activation even later, worsening the situation since LV is already delayed during intrinsic conduction.\n\nD. LV preceding RV by 30 ms - Currently LV precedes RV by 15 ms during BiV pacing. If we increase LV pre-excitation to 30 ms, this would help compensate for the intrinsic LV delay. However, the question states during BiV pacing LV already precedes RV by 15 ms.\n\nE. Enable automatic AV and VV optimization - This is a reasonable option but may not be the most direct answer.\n\nKey Insight:\nThe patient's intrinsic conduction shows LV delayed by 40 ms. During BiV pacing, LV precedes by only 15 ms. To achieve true simultaneous activation accounting for the underlying substrate, we might need more LV pre-excitation. Programming LV to precede RV by 30 ms (option D) would provide additional compensation.\n\nHowever, looking more carefully - if during BiV pacing LV already captures 15 ms before RV, and we want to optimize synchrony, we need to consider what the ideal VV offset should be. Given the 40 ms intrinsic delay, having LV precede by approximately 30 ms during pacing could help achieve better electrical synchrony.\n\nThe answer is (D)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed123", "question_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed123-005", "question": "A 29-year-old woman presents with acute onset of right-sided weakness and aphasia.

It's less invasive than spinal cord stimulation, which is typically reserved for truly refractory cases.\n\nWhile spinal cord stimulation has strong recent evidence (SENZA-PDN), it's generally considered after failing more conservative approaches.

He is alert and cooperative. Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) is initiated at IPAP 12/EPAP 5 cm H2O. After 2 hours, repeat ABG shows pH 7.29, PaCO2 62 mmHg.

However, he is:\n- Alert and cooperative\n- Tolerating the mask\n- Not in immediate respiratory arrest\n\nAnalyzing options:\n\nA. Increase IPAP to 18 cm H2O: The IPAP of 12 is relatively low. Increasing IPAP increases pressure support (IPAP-EPAP difference), which augments tidal volume and improves CO2 clearance. Going from 12 to 18 would increase pressure support from 7 to 13 cm H2O - a reasonable escalation.\n\nB. Intubation: While the patient is worsening, he is still alert, cooperative, and tolerating NIV. Intubation criteria typically include: deteriorating mental status, inability to protect airway, hemodynamic instability, or failure of optimized NIV. The current BiPAP settings haven't been optimized yet.\n\nC. Heliox: This can reduce airway resistance but is not first-line and evidence is limited.\n\nD. High-flow nasal cannula: HFNC is less effective than BiPAP for hypercapnic respiratory failure. This would be a step backward.\n\nE. Increase EPAP to 10: Increasing EPAP helps with oxygenation and auto-PEEP, but the main problem here is hypercapnia (CO2 retention). The pressure support (IPAP-EPAP) would remain the same at 7 cm H2O, which isn't addressing the ventilation issue.\n\nConclusion:\nThe BiPAP settings are suboptimal. IPAP 12 is on the lower end. Before proceeding to intubation, it's appropriate to optimize NIV by increasing IPAP to improve alveolar ventilation and CO2 clearance. The patient is still a candidate for NIV optimization since he's alert and tolerating the mask.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed123", "question_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed123-010", "question": "A 38-year-old woman presents with palpitations and near-syncope.

Accessory pathway effective refractory period of 270 ms\nA shorter ERP indicates a higher-risk pathway. ERP <270 ms is concerning, but 270 ms is borderline.\n\nB. Inducible orthodromic AVRT\nThis confirms the pathway can participate in reentrant circuits, but orthodromic AVRT itself is generally not life-threatening.\n\nC. Accessory pathway located in left lateral position\nLocation affects ablation approach but doesn't determine risk stratification for sudden cardiac death.\n\nD. Shortest pre-excited RR interval during induced atrial fibrillation of 220 ms\nThis is the critical finding. SPERRI <250 ms indicates a high-risk accessory pathway capable of rapid conduction during atrial fibrillation, which could degenerate into ventricular fibrillation. A SPERRI of 220 ms is very short and indicates significant risk of sudden cardiac death. This is the most important risk stratification parameter in WPW syndrome.\n\nE. Decremental conduction properties of the accessory pathway\nDecremental properties actually suggest LOWER risk, as the pathway is less likely to conduct rapidly during atrial fibrillation.\n\nThe SPERRI during atrial fibrillation is the gold standard for risk stratification in WPW syndrome. A value of 220 ms indicates the pathway can conduct very rapidly (up to 273 bpm), putting the patient at significant risk for ventricular fibrillation if atrial fibrillation occurs. This finding most strongly supports proceeding with catheter ablation.\n\nThe answer is (D)"}]
