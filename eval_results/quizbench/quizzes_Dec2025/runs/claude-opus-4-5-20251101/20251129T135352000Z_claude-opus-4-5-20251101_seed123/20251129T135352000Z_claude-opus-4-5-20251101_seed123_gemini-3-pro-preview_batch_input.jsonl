Echocardiography reveals a resting left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient of 85 mmHg, systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve, and septal thickness of 22 mm. Coronary angiography shows a large first septal perforator arising from the left anterior descending artery supplying the basal septum. She is referred for alcohol septal ablation.
