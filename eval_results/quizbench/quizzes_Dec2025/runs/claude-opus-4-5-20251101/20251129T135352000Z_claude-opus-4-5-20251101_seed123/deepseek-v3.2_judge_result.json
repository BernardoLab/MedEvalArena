Echocardiography reveals a resting left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient of 85 mmHg, systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve, and septal thickness of 22 mm. Coronary angiography shows a large first septal perforator arising from the left anterior descending artery supplying the basal septum. She is referred for alcohol septal ablation.

The question asks for the electrophysiologic finding that most strongly supports proceeding with catheter ablation. The keyed answer (D) is correct: the shortest pre-excited RR interval (SPERRI) during induced atrial fibrillation ≤250 ms is the standard high-risk marker for sudden cardiac death in WPW, favoring ablation. The logic is sound: SPERRI directly assesses the pathway's ability to conduct rapid atrial rates to the ventricle. Medical accuracy is high, aligning with ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines.
