Echocardiography reveals a resting left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient of 85 mmHg, systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve, and septal thickness of 22 mm. Coronary angiography shows a large first septal perforator arising from the left anterior descending artery supplying the basal septum. She is referred for alcohol septal ablation. During the procedure, after balloon occlusion of the septal perforator and injection of echocardiographic contrast, opacification is noted in the papillary muscle region in addition to the target septal area. What is the most appropriate next step?", "options": ["Proceed with alcohol injection as planned given adequate septal opacification", "Abort the procedure and refer for surgical myectomy", "Advance the balloon more distally and reassess contrast distribution", "Reduce the planned alcohol volume by 50% and proceed", "Switch to a different septal perforator branch if available"], "answer": "C", "answer_index": 2, "explanation": "Papillary muscle opacification during alcohol septal ablation indicates that alcohol injection would cause papillary muscle necrosis, potentially resulting in severe mitral regurgitation. The appropriate step is to reposition the balloon more distally to exclude the branch supplying the papillary muscle. Proceeding with injection (A) or reducing volume (D) risks catastrophic mitral regurgitation. Aborting immediately (B) is premature before attempting repositioning. Switching perforators (E) may be considered only if repositioning fails and another suitable branch exists.", "generator_model": "claude-opus-4-5-20251101", "seed": 123, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "pred": "E", "model_outputs": "The answer is (E)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed123", "question_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed123-002", "question": "A 34-year-old man presents with progressive gait instability and cognitive decline over 18 months.

During BiV pacing, LV leads RV by only 15 ms, suggesting suboptimal resynchronization. The key issue is that with a 120 ms AV delay, there may be fusion with intrinsic conduction compromising true biventricular capture. Shortening the AV delay ensures complete ventricular capture by the device before intrinsic conduction, maximizing resynchronization benefit.
