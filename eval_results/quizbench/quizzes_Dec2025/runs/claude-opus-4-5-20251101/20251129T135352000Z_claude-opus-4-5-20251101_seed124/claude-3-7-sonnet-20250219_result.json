Absence of late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac MRI - This is a strong predictor of recovery in cardiomyopathies, as it indicates absence of irreversible fibrosis.\n\nB. Normalization of BNP levels - While improved BNP reflects better hemodynamics, it's more a marker of current status than a predictor of complete recovery.\n\nC. Presence of the TTN truncating variant - TTN variants are actually associated with LOWER rates of complete recovery in peripartum cardiomyopathy and are considered a negative prognostic factor.\n\nD. Baseline LVEF above 30% - Higher baseline LVEF is associated with better recovery, but her LVEF was 25%, below this threshold.\n\nE. Multiparity status - Multiple pregnancies are associated with higher risk of peripartum cardiomyopathy but not strongly linked to recovery potential.\n\nThe absence of myocardial fibrosis (indicated by absence of late gadolinium enhancement) is the strongest predictor of complete recovery among these options.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}]
