Key stem clues: d-TGA with intact ventricular septum, restrictive PFO, persistent cyanosis (SpO2 55%) despite PGE1, hemodynamically stable. The clinical problem is identifying the urgent procedure to improve atrial-level mixing to stabilize the neonate before definitive surgery. Balloon atrial septostomy (B) is the standard immediate intervention. Emergent arterial switch (A) is definitive but not the next step before stabilization. ECMO (C) is for refractory cases. Inhaled nitric oxide (D) is for pulmonary hypertension, not the primary issue. Surgical septectomy (E) is more invasive and for failed balloon septostomy. The item is logically valid and medically accurate, aligning with standard neonatal cardiology management. Minimal fix: None required; the item is clear and correct.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"T\",\n    \"logical_validity\": true,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n

Key stem clues: The vignette describes a patient on methotrexate with subacute respiratory symptoms, HRCT showing peribronchovascular GGO/consolidation, and BAL with lymphocytosis and low CD4/CD8 ratio. This combination is classic for organizing pneumonia (OP), a well-documented pattern of methotrexate lung injury. The hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) pattern, while a possible drug reaction, is not the most common for methotrexate; OP and diffuse alveolar damage are more frequently reported. Main logical issue: The provided key (C) does not match the single best answer supported by the clinical picture and literature. Main medical accuracy issue: The rationale incorrectly states HP is the most common pattern. Minimal fix: Change the key to D (Organizing pneumonia) and update the rationale to reflect that OP is a predominant pattern for methotrexate lung toxicity, consistent with the peribronchovascular distribution on imaging.\",\n  \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n  \"logical_validity\": false,\n  \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \"3\"\n}",

Key stem clues: acute anterior STEMI with cardiogenic shock refractory to inotropes/vasopressors, severe LV dysfunction (EF 20%), need for greatest LV unloading. The question asks for the device providing the greatest degree of LV unloading. While Impella 5.5 (E) provides high flow (5.5 L/min), the Impella 5.5 is a surgically implanted device via the axillary artery. In acute refractory cardiogenic shock post-PCI, the typical immediate percutaneous option for maximal LV unloading is the Impella CP (B), which provides up to 4.0 L/min. The provided key (E) is not the standard first-line percutaneous device for this scenario, making the item miskeyed. Main medical accuracy issue: Impella 5.5 is not the typical first-choice percutaneous device in acute refractory shock; Impella CP is. Minimal fix: Change key to B (Impella CP) or, if intent is surgical implant, specify a delayed, stable scenario requiring longer-term support.\",\n  \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n  \"logical_validity\": false,\n  \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n  \"3\"\n}",
