Let's analyze the options:\n\nA. Concomitant intrinsic mitral valve disease requiring repair: Surgical myectomy allows for simultaneous correction of mitral valve abnormalities, such as mitral regurgitation, which is present in this patient. Alcohol septal ablation primarily targets the septum and does not address mitral valve pathology. Therefore, this finding strongly favors surgery.\n\nB. Patient preference for less invasive procedure: Alcohol septal ablation is generally considered less invasive than surgical myectomy. If the patient prefers a less invasive procedure, it would favor alcohol septal ablation, not surgical myectomy.\n\nC. Presence of atrial fibrillation requiring maze procedure consideration: While a maze procedure can be performed concurrently with surgical myectomy, it is not a primary indication to favor myectomy over alcohol septal ablation. Atrial fibrillation can be managed independently or addressed with other interventions.\n\nD. Septal thickness greater than 20 mm: The patient has a septal thickness of 22 mm. While significant septal hypertrophy is present, both surgical myectomy and alcohol septal ablation are effective in reducing LVOT obstruction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with significant septal thickening. This finding alone doesn't strongly favor one over the other.\n\nE. Age greater than 55 years: The patient is 58 years old. Age is a factor in surgical risk, but it doesn't inherently favor surgical myectomy over alcohol septal ablation. In fact, older age might sometimes be a consideration for less invasive options if feasible.\n\nConsidering the options, the presence of concomitant intrinsic mitral valve disease requiring repair is the strongest indication for surgical myectomy, as it can be addressed simultaneously with the septal reduction.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed127", "question_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed127-002", "question": "A 6-year-old boy presents with recurrent episodes of weakness and dark urine following viral illnesses.

The elevated C14:1 and C14:2 acylcarnitine species are indicative of impaired beta-oxidation of very long-chain fatty acids. During metabolic stress (like viral illness), the body relies on fatty acid oxidation for energy. When this pathway is impaired, the body switches to glycogenolysis and then potentially protein catabolism, leading to hypoglycemia and muscle breakdown (elevated CK, myoglobinuria). The non-ketotic hypoglycemia with inappropriately low free fatty acids suggests that the body is unable to mobilize and oxidize fats for energy.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Strict avoidance of medium-chain triglycerides: Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) are a source of medium-chain fatty acids, which can be oxidized via a pathway that bypasses the initial steps of long-chain fatty acid oxidation. Therefore, avoiding MCTs would be detrimental.\n\nB. Supplementation with odd-chain fatty acids: Odd-chain fatty acids are metabolized differently and do not directly address the defect in very long-chain fatty acid oxidation.\n\nC. Restriction of long-chain fatty acids with medium-chain triglyceride supplementation: This is the cornerstone of dietary management for VLCAD deficiency. Restricting long-chain fatty acids reduces the substrate load on the defective enzyme, while MCT supplementation provides an alternative energy source that can be readily oxidized.\n\nD. High-protein diet with branched-chain amino acid supplementation: While protein catabolism can occur during crises, a high-protein diet is generally not recommended as it can increase the burden on the urea cycle and may not be the primary energy source needed. Branched-chain amino acid supplementation is typically for disorders of amino acid metabolism.\n\nE. Carnitine supplementation with unrestricted fat intake: Carnitine is a cofactor for fatty acid transport into mitochondria. While carnitine deficiency can exacerbate fatty acid oxidation defects, the primary issue here is the enzyme defect itself, not necessarily carnitine deficiency. Unrestricted fat intake, especially long-chain fatty acids, would be harmful.\n\nTherefore, restricting long-chain fatty acids and supplementing with MCTs is the most critical dietary modification.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed127", "question_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed127-003", "question": "A 34-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus on hydroxychloroquine and mycophenolate presents with acute onset severe headache, confusion, and seizures.

Low complement C3 and C4 levels:** Low complement levels indicate active systemic lupus erythematosus, which can manifest as either NPSLE or PRES. This finding supports active SLE but doesn't specifically point to NPSLE over PRES.\n*   **C. Elevated CSF IgG index with oligoclonal bands:** An elevated CSF IgG index and the presence of oligoclonal bands in the CSF are indicative of intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis, which is a strong marker for chronic central nervous system inflammation. This is more characteristic of NPSLE, particularly lupus cerebritis, than PRES, which is primarily a vascular phenomenon related to hypertension and endothelial dysfunction. While some inflammatory changes can occur in PRES, the pattern described in option C is more specific for an autoimmune inflammatory process within the CNS, as seen in NPSLE.\n*   **D. Resolution of MRI findings with blood pressure control:** This finding is highly characteristic of PRES. PRES is by definition \"reversible,\" and its resolution with management of the underlying cause (often hypertension) is a key diagnostic feature.

The calcium-stimulated angiography localizing the lesion to the body and tail of the pancreas further supports this diagnosis.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Distal pancreatectomy: Since the lesion is localized to the body and tail, a distal pancreatectomy would be the surgical approach to remove the insulinoma. This is a definitive treatment for insulinoma.\n\nB. Diazoxide therapy: Diazoxide is a somatostatin analog that inhibits insulin release. It can be used to manage hypoglycemia in patients with insulinoma, especially if surgery is not an option or as a bridge to surgery. However, it is a medical management, not the definitive treatment when a localized lesion is identified.\n\nC. Octreotide therapy: Octreotide is a somatostatin analog that also inhibits insulin release. Similar to diazoxide, it is a medical management option for hypoglycemia.\n\nD. Dietary modification with acarbose: Acarbose is an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor that slows carbohydrate absorption. While dietary modifications are important for managing hypoglycemia, acarbose is not the primary treatment for a confirmed insulinoma.\n\nE. Enucleation of insulinoma: Enucleation is a surgical technique to remove a benign tumor while preserving the surrounding pancreatic tissue. This is often preferred for smaller, benign insulinomas, especially those located in the head of the pancreas, to minimize pancreatic insufficiency. However, given the location in the body and tail, a distal pancreatectomy might be more appropriate to ensure complete removal and avoid recurrence, especially if the tumor is larger or has features suggesting malignancy (though malignancy is less likely given the presentation). However, enucleation is a surgical option for insulinomas.\n\nConsidering the localization of the insulinoma to the body and tail of the pancreas, surgical resection is the most appropriate next step for definitive management. Between distal pancreatectomy and enucleation, distal pancreatectomy is generally considered for lesions in the body and tail to ensure complete tumor removal and minimize the risk of recurrence. While enucleation is an option for benign insulinomas, the extent of resection depends on the tumor's size, location, and characteristics. Given the options, surgical intervention is paramount.

Let's analyze the options:\n\n*   **A. Presence of cardiomyopathy at diagnosis:** Severe cardiomyopathy, as described in the case (severe biventricular hypertrophy, LVEF 25%), is a significant indicator of advanced disease. ERT is most effective when initiated before irreversible organ damage occurs. Therefore, the presence of severe cardiomyopathy at diagnosis is a strong predictor of a poorer response to ERT.\n\n*   **B. Cross-reactive immunologic material (CRIM) negative status:** CRIM-negative status means the patient produces no endogenous enzyme. While this is important for understanding the disease and potential immune responses to ERT, it is generally associated with a *better* response to ERT because the exogenous enzyme has a clearer target and less competition from any residual endogenous enzyme. CRIM-positive patients may have some endogenous enzyme, which can contribute to a better baseline, but the absence of any endogenous enzyme (CRIM-negative) doesn't inherently predict a *poor* response to ERT itself.

The infant in the case is 3 weeks old, which is early, but this factor itself predicts a *better*, not poorer, response.\n\n*   **D. Elevated creatine kinase level:** Elevated creatine kinase (CK) is a marker of muscle damage.

He has received multiple appropriate shocks and ATP, indicating the VT is not well-controlled.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Increasing amiodarone to 600 mg daily: While amiodarone is a potent antiarrhythmic, increasing the dose further may not be effective and can lead to increased toxicity, especially given the patient's age and underlying cardiomyopathy. The current dose is already significant.\n\nB. Adding mexiletine 200 mg three times daily: Mexiletine is a Class Ib antiarrhythmic. While it can be used for VT, it is generally more effective for VT associated with myocardial infarction and less so for VT in the setting of dilated cardiomyopathy. Its efficacy in this scenario is questionable, and it can have proarrhythmic effects.\n\nC. Urgent catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia: Given the recurrent VT despite antiarrhythmic therapy, catheter ablation is a highly effective option for controlling VT, especially in patients with structural heart disease. It directly targets the arrhythmogenic substrate. This is a strong contender.\n\nD. Initiate dofetilide after appropriate QTc assessment: Dofetilide is a Class III antiarrhythmic. However, it requires careful initiation and monitoring due to the risk of torsades de pointes, especially in patients with prolonged QTc. While the current QTc is 485 ms, which is borderline prolonged, initiating a new drug with potential QTc prolongation risk in a patient already experiencing recurrent VT might not be the safest or most effective immediate step. Furthermore, amiodarone has already been tried.\n\nE. Add ranolazine 500 mg twice daily: Ranolazine is a late sodium channel blocker that can be effective in suppressing VT, particularly in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. It has a favorable safety profile regarding QTc prolongation and is often used as an add-on therapy when other agents are insufficient or not tolerated. In the context of recurrent VT despite amiodarone, adding ranolazine is a reasonable next step to improve VT control.\n\nComparing options C and E: Catheter ablation (C) is a definitive treatment for VT and is highly effective. However, it is an invasive procedure. Ranolazine (E) is a pharmacological option that can be initiated relatively quickly and has shown efficacy in suppressing VT in patients with structural heart disease. Given the patient is hemodynamically stable and the question asks for the \"most appropriate next step,\" adding ranolazine is a less invasive and often effective strategy to try before proceeding to ablation, especially if the goal is to stabilize the patient and reduce shock burden while considering further management. However, the recurrent nature and multiple shocks suggest a more aggressive approach might be warranted.\n\nRe-evaluating: The patient has received *three* appropriate shocks in 24 hours despite amiodarone. This indicates significant electrical instability. While ranolazine is a good option, the severity of the VT burden might make ablation the more definitive and urgent next step to prevent further shocks and potential hemodynamic compromise. In patients with recurrent VT despite antiarrhythmic drugs, ablation is often considered the next step.\n\nLet's consider the guidelines.

It is a more invasive procedure.\n\nE. Initiate norepinephrine and observe: While vasopressors like norepinephrine are used to support blood pressure in shock, they are adjunctive measures. In the context of massive PE, addressing the underlying cause (the clot) with reperfusion therapy is paramount. Simply supporting blood pressure without removing the obstruction will not resolve the PE.\n\nConsidering the patient's profound hypotension and evidence of right ventricular strain from massive PE, systemic thrombolysis with alteplase is the most appropriate immediate next step to restore hemodynamic stability.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed127", "question_id": "20251129T135352000Z_claude-opus-4-5-20251101_seed127-009", "question": "A 28-year-old woman with Graves' disease treated with methimazole 30 mg daily for 8 weeks presents with fever (39.2°C), severe sore throat, and malaise for 2 days.

Management requires immediate discontinuation of the offending thionamide (cross-reactivity precludes switching to PTU), blood cultures, broad-spectrum antibiotics covering Pseudomonas given febrile neutropenia, and G-CSF to accelerate neutrophil recovery.

Methimazole is a known cause of agranulocytosis, a potentially life-threatening side effect. Therefore, the immediate management should focus on addressing this adverse reaction.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while switching to propylthiouracil (PTU) might be considered in some thyroid storm scenarios, it doesn't directly address the immediate life-threatening agranulocytosis. PTU can also cause agranulocytosis.\n\nOption B is the most appropriate immediate management. Discontinuing methimazole is crucial. Obtaining blood cultures is important to identify any underlying infection contributing to the fever and neutropenia. Initiating broad-spectrum antibiotics is necessary to treat or prevent a severe infection in an immunocompromised state. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) can help stimulate neutrophil production and recovery.\n\nOption C is incorrect. Continuing methimazole, even at a reduced dose, would be dangerous given the severe neutropenia.\n\nOption D is incorrect. Urgent thyroidectomy is not indicated for agranulocytosis. While thyroidectomy might be a treatment for Graves' disease, it is not the immediate priority when a patient develops a severe adverse drug reaction like agranulocytosis.\n\nOption E is incorrect.

This is due to high thrombotic risk within aneurysms. The absence of current ischemia does not reduce thrombotic risk.

Current guidelines for patients with giant coronary artery aneurysms, especially those with a history of Kawasaki disease, recommend aggressive antithrombotic therapy to prevent thrombus formation and subsequent complications like myocardial infarction.\n\nOption A: Addition of warfarin with a target INR of 2.0-3.0 is a strong recommendation for patients with giant coronary artery aneurysms, particularly those with a history of Kawasaki disease, to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events. This is a standard approach in managing such high-risk aneurysms.\n\nOption B: Discontinuation of clopidogrel is not recommended. Dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel) is often used in these patients, and stopping clopidogrel without a clear indication or alternative strategy could increase the risk of thrombosis. The absence of inducible ischemia does not negate the risk associated with large aneurysms.\n\nOption C: Annual exercise stress testing is important for monitoring, but it is not the *most strongly recommended additional intervention* for managing the risk of thrombosis in giant aneurysms. The primary concern is preventing clot formation within the aneurysms.\n\nOption D: Coronary CT angiography every 5 years is a reasonable surveillance tool for assessing aneurysm size and morphology, but it is not an *intervention* to prevent complications. The frequency might also be considered too infrequent given the size of the aneurysms.\n\nOption E: Restriction from all competitive sports is a consideration for patients with significant coronary artery abnormalities, but it is not the *most strongly recommended additional intervention* for managing the aneurysms themselves. While activity modification might be discussed, the primary focus for these giant aneurysms is antithrombotic therapy.\n\nGiven the presence of giant coronary artery aneurysms, the most strongly recommended additional intervention to reduce the risk of thromboembolic complications is the addition of warfarin.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}]
