Verdict: Correct best answer. The vignette describes a 14-year-old with classic juvenile dermatomyositis (heliotrope rash, Gottron papules, proximal weakness, elevated CK, perifascicular atrophy) who is anti-MDA5 antibody positive with early ILD (ground-glass opacities, reduced DLCO). The question asks which finding most significantly increases risk of rapidly progressive ILD (RP-ILD) in this context. Key discriminating finding: anti-MDA5 positivity is established. Anti-MDA5-positive dermatomyositis carries high risk for RP-ILD, and elevated ferritin is a validated biomarker for RP-ILD severity and poor prognosis in this specific antibody subset, reflecting macrophage activation syndrome. Option A (elevated ferritin) is the keyed answer and is medically accurate. Option B (mechanic's hands) associates with antisynthetase syndrome, not specifically RP-ILD risk in anti-MDA5 disease. Option C (anti-Jo-1) would contradict the stated anti-MDA5 positivity and associates with chronic ILD. Option D (calcinosis) is a JDM feature but not a RP-ILD predictor. Option E (elevated aldolase) is nonspecific muscle enzyme elevation. The stem provides sufficient detail to identify a unique best answer.
