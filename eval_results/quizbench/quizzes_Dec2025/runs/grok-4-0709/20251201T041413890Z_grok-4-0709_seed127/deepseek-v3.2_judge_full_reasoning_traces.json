Key stem clues: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with obstruction (LVOT gradient 80 mmHg), recurrent syncope, refractory to optimal beta-blocker therapy. The vignette describes a patient with symptomatic obstructive HCM despite beta-blockers, which per major guidelines (ACC/AHA, ESC) warrants escalation to invasive septal reduction therapy (surgical myectomy or alcohol septal ablation) as the next step for severe, drug-refractory cases. Disopyramide is an add-on oral therapy, but its use is typically before or alongside beta-blockers, not as the sole next step after beta-blocker failure in a patient with severe obstruction and syncope. The keyed answer (D) is not the single best answer; option B (surgical myectomy) is the most guideline-supported choice. Main medical accuracy issue: the rationale incorrectly positions disopyramide as the definitive next step after beta-blocker failure, which contradicts standard management algorithms. Minimal fix: Change the key to B (surgical myectomy) and update the rationale to reflect guideline-based escalation to septal reduction therapy for severe, refractory obstructive HCM.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n    \"logical_validity\": false,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n  \"2\"\n}",

Key stem clues: recurrent UTIs, vesicoureteral reflux, mild hydronephrosis, breakthrough infections, and a PAX2 gene mutation. The question asks for the syndrome most likely associated with this genetic finding. The vignette is internally consistent and provides a specific, discriminating genetic marker (PAX2). The keyed answer (B, Renal coloboma syndrome) is the only option directly linked to PAX2 mutations, which is a well-established association in medical genetics. All other options are associated with different genes (WT1, EYA1, collagen IV), making them incorrect. No logical contradictions or missing details prevent a unique answer. Medical accuracy is sound.

Key stem clues: acute PE in a non-pregnant, non-cancer patient with provoked risk factors (OCP, flight, family history, elevated factor VIII). The patient is hemodynamically stable (no mention of hypotension or shock). Main logical issue: None. Main medical accuracy issue: None. The vignette is consistent with current ACCP/ESC guidelines where DOACs (e.g., rivaroxaban) are first-line for acute PE in stable patients. Option A is a valid but less preferred alternative. Option C (thrombolysis) is for massive/high-risk PE. Options D and E are incorrect (fondaparinux is not standard monotherapy; antiplatelets are insufficient). Minimal fix: None required; the item is clear and accurate. Adding 'She is hemodynamically stable' would further rule out thrombolysis but is not strictly necessary.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"T\",\n    \"logical_validity\": true,\n

Key stem clues: symmetric polyarthritis, morning stiffness, positive anti-CCP antibodies, and elevated inflammatory markers are classic for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The rash and poor response to methotrexate are atypical but can occur in severe or refractory RA. The mention of an NLRP3 mutation is a major distracter, as it is pathognomonic for cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), which are autoinflammatory disorders. However, CAPS does not present with anti-CCP antibodies, a highly specific serologic marker for RA. This creates a fundamental contradiction: the stem provides two mutually exclusive diagnostic anchors (anti-CCP for RA, NLRP3 for CAPS). A unique best answer cannot be determined from the conflicting data. Main logical issue: Contradiction (C) due to incompatible diagnostic clues. Main medical accuracy issue: Combining a highly specific RA marker with a definitive CAPS mutation is clinically unrealistic. Minimal fix: Remove either the anti-CCP positivity or the NLRP3 mutation to align the vignette with a single coherent diagnosis.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"C\",\n    \"logical_validity\":

The vignette describes a child with short stature, delayed bone age, low IGF-1, normal GH stimulation, and a confirmed IGF1R gene mutation. This constellation is diagnostic of primary IGF-1 deficiency due to IGF-1 resistance. The keyed answer (B, IGF-1 replacement therapy) is not the standard of care; recombinant IGF-1 (mecasermin) is FDA-approved for severe primary IGF-1 deficiency, but its use is highly specialized, often reserved for severe cases, and not universally considered the first-line 'most appropriate management strategy' for all IGF1R mutations. Option A (recombinant growth hormone) is correctly identified as ineffective. However, the stem lacks critical details (e.g., severity, nutritional status, exclusion of other deficiencies) to uniquely justify starting a complex, injectable hormone therapy over a comprehensive evaluation and initial supportive measures (Option C, nutritional supplementation), which is a common first step. This underspecification (U) leads to multiple defensible answers (M). Main medical issue: oversimplification of a nuanced management pathway. Minimal fix: Specify 'severe primary IGF-1 deficiency unresponsive to nutritional optimization' to justify IGF-1 replacement as the clear best answer.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n

Key stem clues: acute pancreatitis with necrosis, hypotension, acute kidney injury, and severe hypertriglyceridemia (1200 mg/dL) in an emergency setting. The question asks for the most appropriate initial management for the hypertriglyceridemia. Insulin infusion is the standard acute intervention to rapidly lower triglycerides by activating lipoprotein lipase, aligning with major guidelines. Plasmapheresis is a second-line option for severe or refractory cases. Oral agents (fibrates, niacin, statins) are for chronic control, not acute crisis management. No logical contradictions or missing critical details are present; a single best answer is supported. Medical accuracy is sound. Minimal fix: None required for a valid item; optionally, the stem could specify 'initial' more explicitly to preempt debate about plasmapheresis timing.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"T\",\n

Key stem clues: fever, weight loss, lymphadenopathy, non-caseating granulomas, elevated serum ACE, and history of infliximab therapy. These findings are classic for sarcoidosis. However, the keyed answer (B) introduces a pathophysiologic mechanism (drug-induced) not supported by the vignette, which only states the patient is 'on infliximab.' The most likely diagnosis based on the findings is sarcoidosis, but the stem does not provide evidence to distinguish between de novo sarcoidosis and a drug-induced phenomenon. Option A (Tuberculosis) is incorrect due to non-caseating granulomas and lack of mention of caseation or positive cultures. The logical issue is miskeying: the single best, defensible diagnosis from the findings is sarcoidosis, but the key specifies an unproven etiology. Minimal fix: Change the key to 'Sarcoidosis' or rephrase option B to 'Sarcoidosis' and adjust the stem to include a temporal link to drug initiation if the teaching point is drug-induced disease.\",\n  \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n  \"logical_validity\": false,\n  \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \"3\"\n}",
