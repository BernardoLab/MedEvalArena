Non-adherence (B) remains common and cannot be ruled out without explicit information. Inadequate dosing in obesity (D) is also a well-documented cause of prophylaxis failure. The item therefore allows multiple defensible answers. Medical accuracy: The explanation correctly identifies DHPS mutations as a resistance mechanism but overstates the diagnostic value of a negative beta-D-glucan to exclude non-adherence, which is a minor inaccuracy.
