Key stem clues: acute stroke-like presentation (hemiparesis, aphasia, diffusion restriction) with positive anti-NMDA receptor antibodies in CSF/serum, normal angiography, and mildly inflammatory CSF. This defines anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. Main logical issue: A unique best answer exists, but the provided key (C, rituximab) is not it. For acute management of confirmed anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, first-line immunotherapy is high-dose intravenous corticosteroids (B) and/or IVIG/plasmapheresis (D), not rituximab as initial step. Rituximab is a second-line or adjunctive agent. Main medical accuracy issue: The rationale incorrectly prioritizes rituximab over first-line immunotherapies. Minimal fix: Change the key to B (high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone) and adjust the rationale to reflect standard first-line immunotherapy sequencing.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n

Key stem clues: Parkinson's patient on levodopa, acute hallucinations/paranoia, worsened UPDRS, CSF with mild lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein, negative HSV PCR. The most likely mechanism is dopaminergic overstimulation (A), a well-known adverse effect of levodopa causing psychosis, especially with dose escalation or disease progression. The CSF findings are nonspecific and mild; they do not definitively point to autoimmune encephalitis over other causes. The keyed answer (C) requires assuming the CSF changes are diagnostic of anti-LGI1, which is not supported without specific antibody testing or typical features like faciobrachial dystonic seizures. Alternatives B and D are chronic processes not explaining acute decompensation. E is not supported. Main logical issue: A unique best answer exists (A), but the provided key (C) is not it. Medical accuracy issue: Overinterpreting mild CSF abnormalities as specific for autoimmune encephalitis. Minimal fix: Change key to A and adjust rationale to acknowledge that mild CSF pleocytosis can occur in drug-induced psychosis or other conditions, not exclusively autoimmune encephalitis.\",\n  \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n  \"logical_validity\": false,\n  \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n  \"3\"\n}",

Key stem clues: 32 weeks gestation, severe pain/bleeding, ultrasound/MRI findings diagnostic of placenta accreta spectrum (abnormal lacunae, loss of retroplacental clear space, myometrial thinning, flow voids). The most appropriate management for a stable patient with a known accreta at 32 weeks is planned, multidisciplinary delivery (often at 34-36 weeks) with cesarean hysterectomy, not immediate delivery. Prophylactic internal iliac artery ligation (E) is an outdated and rarely used technique; current standard is preoperative planning, which may include ureteric stents, cell salvage, and availability of interventional radiology for potential embolization. The keyed answer is not the modern best practice. Immediate cesarean delivery (B) is incorrect for a stable patient, but the provided key (E) is also not the standard primary strategy. Minimal fix: Change key to 'B' and revise rationale to emphasize that for an unstable patient with active bleeding, immediate delivery is indicated, but for a stable patient, the stem should specify stability to make planned delivery the best answer.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n    \"logical_validity\": false,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \"2\"\n}",

Key stem clues: Postoperative fever, leukocytosis, pelvic pain, CT showing a 5 cm complex adnexal mass with gas bubbles, and vaginal cultures growing mixed anaerobes. The presence of gas strongly suggests a gas-forming infection, and the postoperative context points to a surgical complication. Main logical issue: The keyed answer (A, ovarian abscess from bowel perforation) is not the single best answer. Option D (postoperative hematoma with secondary infection) is equally defensible given the postoperative setting, complex mass, and mixed anaerobic flora from the vagina, which could seed a hematoma. A unique best answer requires an unstated assumption that gas bubbles definitively indicate bowel perforation over infection of a hematoma. Main medical accuracy issue: Minor. Both A and D are plausible, but the item incorrectly presents A as uniquely best. Minimal fix: Add a stem detail like 'CT shows a mass contiguous with a bowel wall defect' to favor A, or 'CT shows a mass with an air-fluid level and no direct bowel communication' to favor D.\",\n

Key stem clues: symptomatic obstructive HCM (LVOT gradient 80 mmHg at rest, increasing to 120 mmHg) refractory to beta-blockers, with a known MYH7 mutation. The most appropriate next intervention per major guidelines (ACC/AHA) for drug-refractory, severely symptomatic obstructive HCM is invasive septal reduction therapy (surgical myectomy or, in select cases, alcohol septal ablation). Mavacamten is a newer medical therapy, but current guidelines position it as an option for patients who are not candidates for or decline septal reduction therapy, not as the definitive 'most appropriate next intervention' over proven invasive therapies in this severe, refractory case. Main logical issue: The keyed answer (E) is not the single best, guideline-supported next step.

Key stem clues: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) in a stable patient (hemodynamically stable, TIMI 3 flow) on a direct oral anticoagulant (apixaban). The standard of care for stable SCAD is conservative management, which includes stopping anticoagulation and initiating antiplatelet therapy, often dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), to promote healing and prevent thrombosis. Beta-blockers are a supportive component but not the sole management. The keyed answer (E) is incomplete and incorrect as the sole best choice. Option C (Switch to dual antiplatelet therapy) is the most appropriate single best answer, as it directly addresses the need to stop anticoagulation and initiate standard medical therapy. Main logical issue: The key does not match the single best answer.

The question asks for the most appropriate therapeutic intervention for confirmed Lassa fever with renal complications. Intravenous ribavirin is the standard antiviral for Lassa fever, supported by guidelines and evidence for reducing mortality, especially in severe cases. The alternatives are inferior: B (supportive hemodialysis) is a component of care but not the primary therapeutic intervention; C (convalescent plasma) has limited evidence and is not standard; D (favipiravir) is investigational; E (monoclonal antibodies) are not approved for Lassa. No logical contradictions or underspecification exist. Medical accuracy is sound. Minimal fix: None required; the item is clear and accurate.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"T\",\n    \"logical_validity\": true,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n

Key stem clues: immunocompromised lung transplant patient on TMP-SMX prophylaxis with PJP breakthrough infection and negative serum beta-D-glucan. The negative beta-D-glucan is a critical but ambiguous detail; it is not a reliable marker of fungal burden or adherence in this context, and its inclusion does not logically exclude non-adherence (B) or support a genetic mutation (A) over other options. Main logical issue: The stem is underspecified. The negative beta-D-glucan is presented as a discriminator but does not provide a clear, unique path to the keyed answer (A) without assuming it indicates a low organism burden, which is not a definitive association. Options D (inadequate dosing) and B remain plausible without additional data on weight or adherence history. Main medical accuracy issue: The association between a negative beta-D-glucan and a low fungal burden in PJP is not reliable for ruling out non-adherence or confirming resistance. Minimal fix: Remove the ambiguous beta-D-glucan result and specify confirmed prophylaxis adherence and appropriate weight-based dosing to make genetic resistance (A) the clear best answer.\",\n  \"logical_false_reason\": \"U\",\n  \"logical_validity\": false,\n  \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n  \"3\"\n}",

Key stem clues: Rheumatoid arthritis on tofacitinib, fever, pancytopenia, hyperferritinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypofibrinogenemia, hemophagocytosis on bone marrow—all diagnostic for secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)/macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). The most appropriate initial treatment for secondary HLH/MAS, per current guidelines (HLH-94/2004, ACR/EULAR), is high-dose glucocorticoids (often with anakinra added, but steroids are first-line). Anakinra (C) is a valid early agent, especially in rheumatologic MAS, but is not universally accepted as the sole initial treatment over steroids. Option A (high-dose glucocorticoids) is equally or more defensible as first-line, making the key not uniquely best. Main logical issue: Miskeying—a unique best answer exists (A or C), but the provided key (C) is not clearly superior. Minimal fix: Change key to A or revise stem to specify \\\"refractory to high-dose glucocorticoids\\\" to justify C as initial.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n    \"logical_validity\":

Key stem clues: Giant cell arteritis (GCA) with jaw claudication and vision loss (high-risk features), negative temporal artery biopsy, CTA showing aortic arch involvement (large-vessel GCA), and patient already on a prednisone taper with disease progression. This defines refractory GCA with large-vessel involvement. The keyed answer (C, tocilizumab) aligns with current guidelines (e.g., GiACTA trial) for refractory or relapsing GCA, especially with large-vessel disease, to reduce steroid use and prevent relapse. Alternatives are inferior: A (high-dose prednisone) is failing; B (methotrexate) is a steroid-sparer but less effective for vision-threatening or refractory cases; D (cyclophosphamide) is reserved for severe, life-threatening vasculitis; E (ultrasound) is diagnostic, not therapeutic escalation. No logical contradictions or missing critical details. Medical accuracy is sound.
