This suggests microscopic vascular obstruction. The bone marrow infiltration with tumor cells is particularly significant.\n\nTumor microembolism syndrome occurs when tumor cells create microscopic emboli in the pulmonary vasculature, causing pulmonary hypertension and right heart strain. These microemboli are too small to be visualized on CT angiography. The bone marrow infiltration supports hematogenous spread of tumor cells, which is consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nPaclitaxel-induced pneumonitis typically presents with interstitial infiltrates rather than right ventricular strain.
