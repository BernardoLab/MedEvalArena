Drug-induced lung disease (hydroxychloroquine): Hydroxychloroquine can cause interstitial lung disease, though rare. The pattern described could fit.\n\n2. SLE-related ILD: Possible, but typically shows different patterns.\n\n3. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP): The findings are classic for HP:\n   - Ground-glass opacities with subpleural sparing (characteristic of HP)\n   - Lymphocytic BAL with low CD4:CD8 ratio (typical of HP, unlike sarcoidosis which has high ratio)\n   - Restrictive pattern with reduced DLCO\n\n4. Nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP): Can occur in SLE but typically doesn't show subpleural sparing pattern described here.\n\nCritical Analysis:\n\nThe subpleural sparing and low CD4:CD8 ratio (0.8) are highly suggestive of hypersensitivity pneumonitis rather than typical SLE-ILD or UIP pattern. However, hydroxychloroquine-induced pneumonitis can present similarly and is essentially a drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction.\n\nGiven:\n- Patient is on hydroxychloroquine (known to cause drug-induced ILD, though rare)\n- Classic HP-like pattern on imaging and BAL\n- The most appropriate initial step would be to discontinue the potential offending agent\n\nOption C (discontinue hydroxychloroquine and observe) is reasonable for suspected drug-induced lung disease, but 4 weeks observation with severe disease (DLCO 38%) may be too conservative.\n\nOption A (high-dose steroids) would be appropriate for severe drug-induced pneumonitis or HP, especially given the severity (DLCO 38%).\n\nGiven the severity of disease (DLCO 38% is severely reduced) and progressive symptoms over 3 weeks, simply discontinuing the drug and observing may not be sufficient.

Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) - Classic features include:\n- Hypertension (present: 150/95)\n- Posterior predominant vasogenic edema (present)\n- Headache, confusion, visual symptoms (present)\n- Can occur in pregnancy/preeclampsia spectrum\n- The bilateral posterior parietal-occipital distribution is classic for PRES\n\nC. Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome (RCVS) - Typically presents with thunderclap headache, and imaging would show multifocal arterial narrowing.

Meropenem is appropriate for ESBL-producing organisms - it's a carbapenem and the drug of choice for ESBL infections. Switching to piperacillin-tazobactam (B) would be inappropriate as ESBL organisms are typically resistant to it.\n\n2. Adding vancomycin (A) - There's no indication of gram-positive infection; cultures grew E. coli only.\n\n3. TIPS placement (C) - This is not indicated for SBP treatment; it's used for refractory ascites or variceal bleeding.\n\n4. Adding metronidazole (E) - Anaerobic coverage is not typically needed for SBP, which is usually caused by enteric gram-negative organisms or streptococci.\n\n5. Albumin administration (D) - This is crucial! Studies (particularly the Sort et al. study) have shown that IV albumin (1.5 g/kg on day 1 and 1.0 g/kg on day 3) significantly reduces the incidence of hepatorenal syndrome and mortality in patients with SBP. This is standard of care for SBP treatment.\n\nThe critical issue here: The patient is on appropriate antibiotic therapy (meropenem for ESBL), but there's no mention of albumin being given. The worsening encephalopathy and persistent symptoms despite appropriate antibiotics could be related to developing hepatorenal syndrome or inadequate volume support. The negative cultures on repeat suggest the antibiotic is working, but the neutrophil count hasn't decreased significantly.\n\nAlbumin administration is a proven adjunctive therapy that improves outcomes in SBP and should have been started at diagnosis.\n\nThe answer is (D)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251205T082731900Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed124", "question_id": "20251205T082731900Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed124-005", "question": "A 41-year-old woman with antiphospholipid syndrome (triple positive) on warfarin (INR 2.8) presents with acute right hemiparesis and aphasia.

IV tPA (Option A): This patient has a therapeutic INR of 2.8, which is a contraindication to IV tPA. IV alteplase is contraindicated when INR >1.7 due to increased bleeding risk.\n\n2. Mechanical thrombectomy (Option B): Current guidelines support mechanical thrombectomy for large vessel occlusions (like M1) within 6 hours (and up to 24 hours in select patients). Importantly, anticoagulation with warfarin is NOT a contraindication to mechanical thrombectomy. This is a major advantage in anticoagulated patients who cannot receive IV tPA.\n\n3.

Methotrexate pneumonitis: Typically shows diffuse ground-glass opacities, may have hypersensitivity-like pattern, but doesn't typically show tree-in-bud pattern or granulomas consistently.\n\nB. RA-associated ILD: Usually presents as UIP or NSIP pattern with lower lobe predominance, fibrosis, and honeycombing. Not typically associated with tree-in-bud or granulomas.\n\nC. Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection: \n- Methotrexate causes immunosuppression, increasing infection risk\n- Tree-in-bud pattern is classic for mycobacterial infection\n- Centrilobular nodules are characteristic\n- Upper lobe involvement is typical for mycobacterial disease\n- Non-necrotizing granulomas with multinucleated giant cells are the hallmark histopathology of mycobacterial infection\n- This fits perfectly\n\nD. Sarcoidosis: Shows non-necrotizing granulomas but typically has hilar lymphadenopathy, perilymphatic nodules (not centrilobular), and doesn't typically show tree-in-bud pattern.\n\nE. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis: Can show centrilobular nodules and ground-glass opacities with upper/mid-zone predominance, and poorly formed granulomas, but tree-in-bud pattern is not characteristic.\n\nThe combination of:\n1. Immunosuppression (methotrexate)\n2. Tree-in-bud pattern (highly suggestive of infectious bronchiolitis)\n3. Centrilobular nodules\n4. Upper lobe predominance\n5.

This subtype shows characteristic skin findings but often minimal muscle involvement, with MAC deposition on capillaries. While aspiration (A) and cardiac issues (B) occur in myositis, RP-ILD is the most lethal complication in anti-MDA5 patients. Malignancy risk (D) is lower with anti-MDA5 than with anti-TIF1γ.
