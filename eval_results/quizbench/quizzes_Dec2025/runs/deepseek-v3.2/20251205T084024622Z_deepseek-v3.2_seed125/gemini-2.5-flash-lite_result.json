The patient is currently on enzalutamide for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Pulmonary embolism has been ruled out by CT pulmonary angiography.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Discontinue enzalutamide and initiate high-dose corticosteroids: Enzalutamide can rarely cause interstitial lung disease (ILD). The clinical presentation (dyspnea, hypoxia), CT findings (GGO), and BAL findings (lymphocytic predominance, low CD4:CD8 ratio) are all consistent with drug-induced pneumonitis or other forms of inflammatory ILD. In suspected drug-induced ILD, the first step is to discontinue the offending agent, followed by treatment with corticosteroids. This option addresses the most likely reversible cause of the patient's symptoms.\n\nB. Initiate empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics for atypical pneumonia: The patient has no fever, which makes typical bacterial pneumonia less likely. While atypical pneumonias can cause ILD-like patterns, the lymphocytic predominance in BAL is less typical for bacterial atypical pneumonia and more suggestive of viral, hypersensitivity, or drug-induced processes. Given the presence of a potential offending drug, addressing that is a higher priority.\n\nC. Add abiraterone to his current regimen and continue enzalutamide: Abiraterone is another form of androgen deprivation therapy. Adding it would not directly address the acute pulmonary symptoms, and if enzalutamide is the cause of the lung issue, continuing it is not advisable.\n\nD. Perform transbronchial biopsy to rule out lymphangitic carcinomatosis: While lymphangitic carcinomatosis is a possibility in mCRPC, the CT pattern described (\"diffuse ground-glass opacities with peripheral sparing\") is not the most classic presentation of lymphangitic carcinomatosis, which typically shows reticular or nodular interstitial thickening, often with septal and peribronchovascular thickening. Furthermore, the lymphocytic predominance in BAL is more suggestive of an inflammatory or immune-mediated process rather than a direct malignant infiltration, although tumor cells can elicit an inflammatory response. Given a potentially reversible cause (drug toxicity), investigating this first is more appropriate than an invasive biopsy for what may not be the most likely diagnosis based on imaging.\n\nE. Start therapeutic-dose low-molecular-weight heparin for occult pulmonary embolism: The CT pulmonary angiography explicitly ruled out pulmonary embolism, so this option is unwarranted.\n\nConsidering the diagnostic possibilities, drug-induced pneumonitis from enzalutamide is a significant concern given the temporal proximity of enzalutamide treatment, the symptoms, and the imaging/BAL findings. Therefore, discontinuing the suspected causative agent and initiating anti-inflammatory treatment is the most appropriate next step.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A}$."}, {"quiz_id": "20251205T084024622Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed125", "question_id": "20251205T084024622Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed125-002", "question": "A 4-month-old previously healthy infant presents with acute onset of irritability, vomiting, and lethargy.

However, the question asks for an additional finding that would most strongly support a diagnosis of glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA-1) *rather than* NAT.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\nA. Metaphyseal corner fractures on skeletal survey: These are classic signs of abusive head trauma and would strongly support NAT, not GA-1.\nB. Elevated serum ammonia level: Elevated ammonia can be seen in various metabolic encephalopathies, including some urea cycle defects or liver dysfunction. While GA-1 can sometimes lead to elevated ammonia during crises, it is not a specific or primary diagnostic finding for GA-1, and a normal initial metabolic panel doesn't exclude it.\nC. Frontotemporal atrophy with widened Sylvian fissures on MRI: This pattern of brain atrophy is a characteristic neuroimaging finding in chronic GA-1, resulting from selective damage to the basal ganglia and cerebral white matter. If observed, it would strongly suggest a neurometabolic disorder like GA-1.\nD. Subarachnoid hemorrhage extending into the posterior fossa: Subarachnoid hemorrhage can occur in both NAT and certain metabolic disorders. It is not specific enough to strongly favor GA-1 over NAT.\nE. Elevated urine organic acids showing 3-hydroxyglutaric aciduria: Glutaric aciduria type 1 is caused by a deficiency of glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase, leading to the accumulation of glutaric acid and its metabolite, 3-hydroxyglutaric acid. The detection of 3-hydroxyglutaric aciduria in urine is the pathognomonic biochemical marker for GA-1.\n\nThe initial CT findings of bilateral subdural hematomas of different ages are extremely suggestive of repetitive trauma (NAT). To shift the diagnostic suspicion strongly towards GA-1, definitive evidence of GA-1 would be required. Option E provides this definitive evidence by directly identifying the characteristic biochemical abnormality of GA-1. While subdural hematomas are not the typical primary presentation of GA-1 (which usually involves basal ganglia and white matter injury), reports indicate that neurometabolic disorders can sometimes be associated with findings mimicking trauma, even including subdural collections. Therefore, a confirmed diagnosis of GA-1 through biochemical testing is the most powerful piece of evidence supporting GA-1 as the underlying pathology, necessitating a re-evaluation of the other findings. Option C suggests a characteristic imaging pattern of GA-1, but it is more of a chronic finding and not as definitively diagnostic as the specific biochemical marker identified in Option E.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{E}$."}, {"quiz_id": "20251205T084024622Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed125", "question_id": "20251205T084024622Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed125-003", "question": "A 55-year-old woman with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who failed CAR T-cell therapy 3 months ago presents with new-onset confusion and myoclonus.

This indicates the question is likely asking which of these *treatments* is most likely responsible for the observed neurological symptoms, implying a treatment-related neurotoxicity.\n\nThe patient received CAR T-cell therapy (Tisagenlecleucel) 3 months ago, which she failed. CAR T-cell therapy is known to cause significant neurological complications, collectively termed Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS). ICANS can manifest with confusion, encephalopathy, tremors, myoclonus, speech difficulties, seizures, and even coma. While the MRI findings of symmetric diffusion restriction in the thalami and basal ganglia, along with periodic sharp wave complexes on EEG, are classic for CJD, severe ICANS can also lead to widespread cerebral edema and diffusion abnormalities, including in subcortical structures.

A hyperdynamic left ventricle in the context of septic shock typically indicates low systemic vascular resistance (SVR). The collapsing mitral inflow pattern is a strong indicator of severely reduced preload, meaning the heart is not filling adequately with blood. This is often due to hypovolemia.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\nA. Initiate dobutamine infusion at 5 mcg/kg/min: Dobutamine is an inotrope that increases myocardial contractility and heart rate, but it can also cause vasodilation and increase myocardial oxygen demand. Given the low preload finding, improving filling is a higher priority than increasing contractility, especially since the LV is already hyperdynamic.\nB. Add phenylephrine infusion to target MAP >65 mmHg: Phenylephrine is a pure alpha-1 agonist, causing vasoconstriction and increasing SVR. While it would increase MAP, it would further increase SVR in a state that may already have low SVR and potentially worsen diastolic filling time. Addressing preload deficiency is more critical.\nC. Administer 500 mL 5% albumin bolus: Albumin is a colloid that helps expand intravascular volume. The collapsing mitral inflow pattern strongly suggests hypovolemia and low preload. Administering a fluid bolus directly addresses this most evident problem, aiming to improve cardiac filling and thus stroke volume and cardiac output, which should improve blood pressure. This intervention specifically targets the preload deficit indicated by the echo without directly increasing myocardial oxygen demand in the way an inotrope or high-dose pressor might.\nD. Start angiotensin II infusion at 20 ng/kg/min: Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor used in refractory shock. However, it is generally considered a later-line therapy after other measures, including optimizing fluid status and other vasoactive agents, have been employed. It also increases SVR.\nE. Increase norepinephrine to 0.5 mcg/kg/min: Increasing norepinephrine will increase SVR and potentially cardiac contractility/heart rate. While increasing pressors is common in refractory shock, the echocardiogram findings point to a primary problem of low preload. Simply increasing vasoconstriction without addressing the volume deficit might not be the most effective or safest approach, and it could increase myocardial oxygen demand.\n\nThe most direct and appropriate intervention for a collapsing mitral inflow pattern suggesting hypovolemia is fluid resuscitation. Albumin bolus is a reasonable choice for fluid expansion in a critically ill patient.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251205T084024622Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed125", "question_id": "20251205T084024622Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed125-005", "question": "A 7-year-old boy presents with acute cerebellar ataxia following varicella infection 2 weeks prior.

Anti-GAD65: While anti-GAD65 antibodies can be associated with cerebellar ataxia, stiff-person syndrome, and epilepsy, their specificity for acute post-viral cerebellar ataxia in children is not as high as other candidates.\n\nB. Anti-Hu: Anti-Hu antibodies are strongly associated with paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis, typically occurring in adults with small cell lung cancer. They are very rarely seen in children and are not characteristic of post-viral cerebellar ataxia.\n\nC. Anti-Yo: Anti-Yo antibodies are classic markers of paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, predominantly seen in adult women with gynecological or breast cancer. Their presence in a pediatric post-varicella case is highly unlikely.\n\nD. Anti-Tr/DNER: Anti-Tr/DNER antibodies are primarily linked to paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, often in association with Hodgkin's lymphoma or testicular germ cell tumors in adults.

Anti-mGluR1: Antibodies to metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) are increasingly recognized as a cause of autoimmune cerebellar ataxia. mGluR1 is expressed on Purkinje cells, which are severely affected in cerebellar ataxia. There is growing evidence linking anti-mGluR1 antibodies to pediatric autoimmune neurological disorders, including post-infectious cerebellar ataxias. These antibodies can be triggered by viral infections through molecular mimicry, leading to an autoimmune attack on cerebellar structures.

Treatment typically involves chemotherapy combined with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) like imatinib or dasatinib. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is an important treatment modality, often considered for patients with Ph+ ALL, especially for those with higher risk features or persistent disease.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. Presence of IKZF1 deletion: IKZF1 deletions are associated with a worse prognosis in Ph+ ALL and can be a factor favouring allo-HSCT.\nB. Age >40 years: Age is a general prognostic factor. While older age can increase the risk of relapse or transplant-related complications, it is not as specific an indicator for transplant in first CR compared to other factors, especially when effective chemo+TKI is an alternative.\nC. MRD positivity after consolidation therapy: Minimal residual disease (MRD) is a powerful predictor of relapse. If MRD remains detectable after consolidation therapy (which includes chemo and TKI), it indicates persistent leukemia that is unlikely to be eradicated by further conventional chemotherapy and TKI alone. In such a scenario, allo-HSCT is strongly indicated in first CR as it offers the best chance for durable remission and cure due to its potent antileukemic effect.\nD. White blood cell count >30,000/μL at diagnosis: A high WBC count at diagnosis is an adverse prognostic factor, but it relates to the initial disease burden and is less critical for the decision-making process after achieving remission and consolidation therapy compared to current disease status.\nE. Presence of additional cytogenetic abnormalities besides t(9;22): Additional cytogenetic abnormalities (ACAs) in Ph+ ALL are associated with a higher risk of relapse and are a consideration for allo-HSCT.\n\nComparing the options, MRD positivity after consolidation therapy (C) is the most compelling factor for pursuing allo-HSCT over continued chemotherapy plus TKI. It directly reflects the effectiveness of the current treatment regimen (chemo + TKI) in eradicating leukemia cells. If MRD is still present, the risk of relapse is very high, and allo-HSCT provides the most effective strategy for achieving long-term remission in such cases. While IKZF1 deletion and ACAs (A and E) are important adverse prognostic markers that might influence the decision, persistent MRD is a more direct and powerful indicator of treatment failure and strong indication for intensifying therapy with transplant.

DiGeorge syndrome is known for thymic hypoplasia/aplasia, leading to T cell deficiency. Live viral vaccines are contraindicated in individuals with significant cellular immunodeficiency.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\nA. CD4+ T cell count <500 cells/μL: While a low CD4+ T cell count indicates impaired T cell immunity, it is not always an absolute contraindication. For instance, in HIV infection, live vaccines are generally avoided if CD4 counts are below 200 cells/μL, but not necessarily at 500 cells/μL. For a 3-year-old, this count might represent a moderate deficiency, but not necessarily an absolute contraindication for all live viral vaccines.\n\nB. Absent thymic shadow on chest radiograph: The thymus is crucial for T cell development. An absent thymic shadow suggests severe thymic hypoplasia or aplasia, which strongly indicates a profound T cell deficiency. However, it is an indirect measure. The absence of the shadow implies a severe problem, but the direct measurement of T cell numbers or function is more definitive.\n\nC. Low but detectable T cell receptor (TREC) levels: TRECs are byproducts of T cell development. Their presence, even at low levels, indicates that some T cell maturation has occurred in the thymus. This suggests existing T cell immunity, making it less likely to be an absolute contraindication compared to states with severe deficiency.\n\nD. Severely reduced proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA): PHA is a mitogen that stimulates T cells. A severely reduced proliferative response indicates significantly impaired T cell function. This is a strong indicator of cellular immunodeficiency and could be considered a contraindication for live viral vaccines, as the immune system would not be able to control the attenuated virus.\n\nE. Complete absence of CD3+ T cells by flow cytometry: CD3 is a pan-T cell marker. Complete absence of CD3+ T cells means there are no T lymphocytes in the circulation. This represents the most severe form of T cell immunodeficiency, such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID), where the immune system is unable to mount an effective T cell response. Live viral vaccines are absolutely contraindicated in SCID because the attenuated virus can replicate uncontrollably and cause disseminated, life-threatening infection. This is a definitive and undisputed absolute contraindication.\n\nComparing D and E: While severe T cell dysfunction (D) is a serious concern and often warrants deferral of live vaccines, the complete absence of T cells (E) is a more absolute and definitive contraindication.

The differential diagnosis includes pituitary metastasis from the known glioblastoma versus autoimmune hypophysitis. We need to identify the finding that most strongly supports lymphocytic hypophysitis over metastasis.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\nA. Presence of anti-pituitary antibodies: Autoimmune hypophysitis is an autoimmune condition, and the presence of autoantibodies directed against pituitary antigens is supportive evidence. However, the sensitivity and specificity of these antibodies can vary, and they may not be present in all cases.\nB. Elevated CSF beta-2 transferrin: Beta-2 transferrin is a marker for CSF leak, which is unrelated to distinguishing hypophysitis from metastasis.\nC. Simultaneous involvement of the pineal gland: While some infiltrative processes can affect multiple midline structures, involvement of the pineal gland is not a specific differentiator between pituitary hypoplasia and metastasis.\nD. Rapid improvement with high-dose corticosteroids: Lymphocytic hypophysitis is an inflammatory condition and typically responds well to corticosteroids. While this is a strong clinical indicator of an inflammatory etiology, it is not entirely specific, as inflammatory responses around metastatic lesions might also show some improvement.\nE. Association with other autoimmune endocrine deficiencies: Lymphocytic hypophysitis is a form of autoimmune hypophysitis and is often part of a broader autoimmune polyendocrinopathy. Conditions like Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Addison's disease, and type 1 diabetes are commonly associated with autoimmune hypophysitis. The presence of such established autoimmune endocrine deficiencies strongly suggests that the patient has a systemic autoimmune disease, making autoimmune hypophysitis the most likely cause of the pituitary findings rather than a metastasis from a brain tumor.\n\nComparing options A, D, and E, option E provides the strongest evidence for a systemic autoimmune diathesis. In a patient with a known malignancy, establishing an autoimmune etiology for new pituitary dysfunction is crucial. The pattern of multiple autoimmune endocrine deficiencies is a hallmark of autoimmune polyendocrinopathy, which frequently includes autoimmune hypophysitis. This makes the autoimmune etiology highly probable and metastasis less likely. While anti-pituitary antibodies (A) are also strong indicators of autoimmunity, the broader systemic autoimmune context (E) is often considered a more definitive indicator of autoimmune hypophysitis as a manifestation of a generalized autoimmune process. Rapid improvement with steroids (D) is a therapeutic clue but less specific than identifying the underlying autoimmune disease process.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{E}$."}, {"quiz_id": "20251205T084024622Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed125", "question_id": "20251205T084024622Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed125-010", "question": "A neonate born at 32 weeks gestation develops necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) on day 10 of life.

A high jejunostomy is a diversionary stoma created from the proximal part of the small intestine. This is typically indicated when the distal bowel is non-viable, too short, or absent, or when creating a primary anastomosis is technically impossible or carries an unacceptably high risk of leak.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\nA. Involvement of the ileocecal valve: This indicates significant disease in the distal small bowel. While it might necessitate extensive resection, if there is adequate healthy proximal jejunum, a primary anastomosis to the cecum or remaining distal ileum might still be considered. It doesn't strictly mandate a jejunostomy over primary anastomosis on its own.\n\nB. Necrosis extending to within 5 cm of the ligament of Treitz: The ligament of Treitz marks the junction between the duodenum and the jejunum. If the necrotic process extends this proximally, it means there is a very limited length of healthy proximal jejunum available for anastomosis (less than 5 cm). In neonates, creating a tension-free and safe primary anastomosis requires generally more length. With such limited proximal bowel, a primary anastomosis to a distal segment would be technically challenging, prone to failure (dehiscence or leak), and could compromise nutritional support. Therefore, this finding mandates diversion, such as creating a high jejunostomy, to allow the distal bowel to heal or be managed later, and to provide a route for enteral feeding.\n\nC. Presence of pneumatosis intestinalis in the remaining bowel: Pneumatosis intestinalis is a sign of bowel ischemia and NEC. While its presence in the remaining bowel is concerning and suggests ongoing or widespread disease, it does not absolutely mandate a jejunostomy over primary anastomosis if there are demonstrably viable segments and sufficient length for a safe connection. Surgeons often assess macroscopic viability and peristalsis in determining suitability for anastomosis.\n\nD. Concurrent isolated perforation of the gastric fundus: A gastric perforation is a separate surgical issue unrelated to the management decision for the small bowel NEC regarding primary anastomosis versus jejunostomy.\n\nE. Development of abdominal compartment syndrome during surgery: Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is a critical condition that requires prompt management. While ACS might lead to a more conservative surgical approach or necessitate leaving the abdomen open for decompression, it doesn't directly mandate a jejunostomy over primary anastomosis as the *best* course of action. The decision for anastomosis versus diversion depends primarily on the viability and length of the bowel ends.\n\nOption B presents the most compelling reason for mandating a jejunostomy. Severe proximal compromise near the ligament of Treitz makes primary anastomosis technically infeasible and unsafe. A high jejunostomy is therefore the required surgical approach.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."}]
