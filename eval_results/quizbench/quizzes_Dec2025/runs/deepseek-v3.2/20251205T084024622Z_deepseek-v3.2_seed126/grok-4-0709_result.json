In patients with DBA-associated cardiomyopathy, addressing the underlying ribosomal dysfunction with leucine supplementation may improve cardiac function, whereas conventional heart failure therapies are less effective for this specific pathophysiology. Beta-blockers/ACE inhibitors would be insufficient, transplantation is premature without addressing the underlying metabolic defect, defibrotide is for hepatic veno-occlusive disease, and advanced imaging would not change management.", "generator_model": "deepseek-v3.2", "seed": 126, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "pred": "E", "model_outputs": "The answer is (E)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251205T084024622Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed126", "question_id": "20251205T084024622Z_deepseek-v3.2_seed126-002", "question": "A 34-year-old pregnant woman at 32 weeks gestation presents with acute-onset severe hypertension (200/120 mmHg), headache, and visual disturbances.
