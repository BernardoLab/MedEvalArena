Key stem clues: 30 weeks, severe features (severe headache, visual changes, RUQ pain, BP >160/110, clonus), lab evidence of HELLP (thrombocytopenia, transaminitis), and persistent severe-range BP after initial hydralazine. The clinical picture mandates seizure prophylaxis with magnesium sulfate, administration of betamethasone for fetal lung maturation given preterm gestation, and expedited delivery, typically within 24-48 hours for severe preeclampsia with HELLP features. Option C correctly bundles these steps. Alternatives are inferior: A and D delay delivery unjustifiably; B omits steroids; E is unsafe outpatient management.

Key stem clues: HBV-positive, systemic symptoms, palpable purpura, mononeuritis multiplex, hypertension, microaneurysms on CT angiography, and high viral load—all consistent with HBV-associated polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). The item correctly requires a strategy addressing both active vasculitis and viral replication. The keyed answer (C: high-dose corticosteroids plus plasma exchange and antiviral therapy) aligns with current guidelines for severe HBV-PAN, which emphasize rapid immunosuppression with steroids and plasma exchange plus immediate antiviral therapy to control viral replication. Alternatives are inferior: A (no antiviral) risks HBV reactivation; B (delayed immunosuppression) allows vasculitis progression; D (rituximab) is not first-line for HBV-PAN; E (no steroids) inadequately treats vasculitis. No contradictions or underspecification; a single best answer is defensible. Minimal fix: none needed; item is clear and accurate.\",\n  \"logical_false_reason\": \"T\",\n  \"logical_validity\": true,\n  \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n  \"5\"\n}",
