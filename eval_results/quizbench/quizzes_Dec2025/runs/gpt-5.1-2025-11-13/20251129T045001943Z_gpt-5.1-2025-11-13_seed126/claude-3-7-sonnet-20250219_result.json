While inhaled nitric oxide might temporarily improve oxygenation, it has not been shown to improve outcomes in ARDS and would likely just delay definitive therapy in this severely hypoxemic patient who has already had limited response to proning.\n\nE. Venoarterial ECMO is not indicated as the primary issue is respiratory failure, not cardiac failure. The patient's hemodynamics are relatively stable on low-dose vasopressors with normal lactate.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed126", "question_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed126-010", "question": "A 10-year-old boy with a history of intermittent asthma presents with 3 weeks of fever, weight loss, night sweats, and progressive joint pains. Exam: non-blanching palpable purpura on lower extremities, mononeuritis multiplex with foot drop, and hypertension (130/86 mmHg). No asthma exacerbation. Labs: ESR 90 mm/hr, CRP 12 mg/dL, creatinine 1.1 mg/dL, urinalysis with 1+ protein and few RBCs, hepatitis B surface antigen positive, high HBV DNA titer, negative ANCA. CT angiography: multiple microaneurysms in mesenteric and renal arteries.

Management requires control of both vasculitis and viral replication: short-course high-dose steroids with plasma exchange and concurrent antiviral therapy is recommended. Prolonged cyclophosphamide without antivirals worsens HBV; antivirals alone are insufficient in active PAN; rituximab is less established in HBV-PAN.", "generator_model": "gpt-5.1-2025-11-13", "seed": 126, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "pred": "B", "model_outputs": "I'll analyze this case of a 10-year-old boy with multiple systemic symptoms and findings.\n\nKey clinical features:\n- 3 weeks of fever, weight loss, night sweats, joint pains\n- Palpable purpura on lower extremities\n- Mononeuritis multiplex with foot drop\n- Hypertension\n- History of asthma (not currently exacerbated)\n- Elevated inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP)\n- Mild renal impairment with proteinuria and hematuria\n- Hepatitis B surface antigen positive with high viral load\n- Negative ANCA\n- Multiple microaneurysms in mesenteric and renal arteries\n\nThis presentation is consistent with polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), a medium vessel vasculitis, which can be associated with hepatitis B infection. The microaneurysms on angiography are classic for PAN.\n\nFor treatment, we need to address both the vasculitis and the hepatitis B infection. Starting immunosuppression without antiviral therapy (option A) could lead to HBV reactivation and worsening hepatitis. Option E (plasma exchange and entecavir only) would be insufficient to control the active vasculitis.\n\nThe most appropriate approach is to start antiviral therapy to control HBV replication while simultaneously treating the vasculitis with immunosuppression. Option B (starting entecavir and delaying immunosuppression) would delay treatment of potentially life-threatening vasculitis.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}]
