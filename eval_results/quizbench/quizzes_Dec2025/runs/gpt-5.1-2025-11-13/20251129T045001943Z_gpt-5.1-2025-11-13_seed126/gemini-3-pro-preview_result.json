The patient has signs of severe preeclampsia (severe hypertension, headache, visual changes, clonus) and laboratory evidence of HELLP (platelets <100,000/µL, elevated AST/ALT).\n\nManagement of HELLP syndrome depends on gestational age and maternal/fetal stability.\n1.  Diagnosis: HELLP Syndrome at 30 weeks (preterm).\n2.  General Principle: The curative treatment for HELLP syndrome is delivery.\n3.  Timing of Delivery:\n    *   For pregnancies < 34 weeks, guidelines (such as ACOG Practice Bulletin 222) recommend administering corticosteroids (betamethasone) for fetal lung maturity and delaying delivery for 24 to 48 hours, provided the maternal and fetal status remain stable.\n    *   Immediate delivery is indicated if there are complications such as abruption, pulmonary edema, eclampsia, DIC, renal failure, or non-reassuring fetal status.\n    *   This patient has severe symptoms and persistent hypertension, but her fetal status is reassuring (Category I) and she does not have signs of frank decompenstation (like eclampsia or shock) described yet. Therefore, she is a candidate for the steroid window.\n4.  Analysis of Options:\n    *   A & D: Expectant management until 34 weeks is contraindicated in HELLP syndrome due to significant maternal and fetal mortality risks.\n    *   E: Outpatient management is inappropriate for severe preeclampsia/HELLP.\n    *   B: Immediate induction without corticosteroids ignores the benefit of lung maturity optimization for a 30-week neonate. While delivery is needed, the standard of care allows for stabilization and steroid administration.\n    *   C: Initiating magnesium sulfate (for seizure prophylaxis given clonus/severe features) and administering betamethasone (for fetal lung maturity), with a plan to deliver soon (typically after the steroid benefit or sooner if deterioration occurs), is the most appropriate management. While the option says \"plan delivery within 24 hours\" (standard might be 24-48), it correctly prioritizes magnesium sulfate and betamethasone followed by delivery, whereas option B omits the critical step of administering corticosteroids.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed126", "question_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed126-002", "question": "A 58-year-old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy (LVEF 20%), CRT-D in place, and NYHA class III symptoms despite optimal GDMT (sacubitril/valsartan, carvedilol, spironolactone, empagliflozin, loop diuretic) presents with weight gain and dyspnea.

Chronic inotropes or short-term MCS alone are not definitive strategies in a transplant/LVAD candidate.", "generator_model": "gpt-5.1-2025-11-13", "seed": 126, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "pred": "D", "model_outputs": "This patient presents with Stage D heart failure (refractory to GDMT) with a reduced ejection fraction (LVEF 20%). He has signs of low cardiac output (CI 1.6-1.7 L/min/m², worsening renal function, hypotension with diuresis) and congestion (PCWP 32 mmHg, ascites, edema). He is classified as INTERMACS profile 4 (resting symptoms, frequent flyer), which defines patients who are stable at rest but have symptoms with any activity and frequent recurrent fluid overload.\n\nLet's evaluate the options for the best *definitive* next step:\n\nA. Add continuous IV milrinone as palliative inotropic therapy: While inotropes might improve hemodynamics temporarily, describing this as \"palliative\" implies the patient is not a candidate for advanced therapies (transplant or MCS). At 58 years old with only mild RV dysfunction and no listed absolute contraindications, he should be evaluated for life-prolonging advanced therapies, not just palliation.\n\nB. Refer for urgent isolated cardiac transplantation listing status 2 without LVAD bridge: Under the UNOS allocation system (post-2018), Status 2 typically requires a patient to be supported by a non-dischargeable mechanical circulatory support device (like an intra-aortic balloon pump or percutaneous ventricular assist device) or have specific complications. A patient on medical therapy or simple inotropes would generally list at Status 4. Therefore, one cannot simply refer for \"Status 2\" without the requisite device support. Furthermore, immediate organ availability is not guaranteed, making this an unreliable immediate definitive step.\n\nC. Evaluate for transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) of the mitral valve: The COAPT trial demonstrated benefit for TEER in selected HF patients with severe secondary MR. However, the trial excluded patients with LVEF < 20% and those in hemodynamic instability/shock (CI < 2.0). This patient has severe LV dysfunction (LVEF 20%) and profound low output (CI 1.6), suggesting that the primary problem is pump failure. While MR contributes to the low output, fixing the valve does not restore contractility to a burnt-out ventricle. Primary treatment of the pump failure (LVAD/Tx) is preferred over valve intervention in Stage D patients eligible for advanced therapies. LVAD implantation effectively unloads the LV and abolishes secondary MR.\n\nD. Refer for durable LVAD implantation as bridge to transplant or destination therapy: This is the most appropriate choice. The patient has severe refractory HF symptoms (INTERMACS 4), is intolerant to neurohormonal blockade due to hypotension/renal failure, and has acceptable RV function (mildly reduced, normal size, RAP/PCWP ratio acceptable). Durable LVAD (e.g., HeartMate 3) provides hemodynamic stability, unloads the LV, improves renal perfusion, and improves survival/quality of life compared to medical management. It serves as a definitive therapy (Destination Therapy) or a Bridge to Transplant. INTERMACS profile 4 patients have excellent survival outcomes with LVAD implantation.\n\nE. Implant a percutaneous Impella device as bridge to decision: Impella is a temporary support device (tMCS) used primarily for patients in cardiogenic shock (INTERMACS 1 or 2) who are crashing, to stabilize them (Bridge to Decision). This patient, while sick, is described as INTERMACS 4 and the question asks for a *definitive* step. Durable LVAD is a definitive therapy. If the patient were crashing acutely, Impella might be used to bridge to the LVAD, but the LVAD referral is the strategic decision.\n\nThe answer is (D)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed126", "question_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed126-003", "question": "A previously healthy 4-year-old boy presents with 10 days of fever to 39.5°C, conjunctival injection without exudate, cracked lips, polymorphous trunk rash, edema and erythema of hands and feet, and cervical lymphadenopathy.

The echocardiogram reveals coronary artery abnormalities (z-scores 2.3-2.7, indicating small aneurysms) and myocardial involvement (mild LV dysfunction with EF 50% and pericardial effusion).\n\nThis patient is considered high-risk for IVIG resistance and coronary artery sequelae due to the presence of coronary artery abnormalities (CAA) at diagnosis, LV dysfunction, and possibly the delayed presentation (Day 10).\n\nAccording to the 2017 AHA Scientific Statement on Kawasaki Disease:\n1.  Standard Therapy: Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) 2 g/kg and high-dose aspirin is the standard induction therapy.\n2.  Adjuvant Therapy: For patients with high-risk features—specifically those with coronary artery aneurysms at diagnosis or those presenting with shock/LV dysfunction—treatment intensification (primary adjunctive therapy) is recommended to reduce the risk of further coronary artery damage. The most established adjunctive therapy in this setting is systemic corticosteroids.\n3.  Specific Regimens: While the optimal steroid regimen (pulse vs. taper) has been debated, the addition of corticosteroids to IVIG is supported by meta-analyses to reduce CAA rates in high-risk patients. Pulse dose methylprednisolone (often 30 mg/kg) is a common mode of administration for intensification, particularly in the presence of cardiac compromise.\n\nEvaluation of Options:\n*   A: Standard therapy alone. While this is the baseline, this patient has high-risk features (aneurysms, LV dysfunction) that warrant more aggressive therapy to halt inflammation immediately.\n*   B: Adds a single dose of IV methylprednisolone (pulse steroids) to standard care. This addresses the high-risk status (especially LV dysfunction and aneurysms). This is the most appropriate strategy among the choices provided.\n*   C: Infliximab with low-dose aspirin. While Infliximab is an alternative adjunctive agent, the use of *low-dose* aspirin is incorrect during the acute febrile phase. High-dose (anti-inflammatory) aspirin is required until the patient is afebrile.\n*   D: Anakinra is currently reserved for refractory KD or cases complicated by Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS), not as standard initial therapy.\n*   E: Incorrect; IVIG is indicated as long as there is evidence of active inflammation (fever, elevated CRP/ESR), even after day 10.\n\nTherefore, the addition of corticosteroids (Option B) represents the appropriate escalation of care for a high-risk patient with established cardiac involvement.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed126", "question_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed126-004", "question": "A 32-year-old woman with mixed connective tissue disease (U1-RNP positive) on mycophenolate mofetil and low-dose prednisone presents with 3 months of progressive exertional dyspnea and near-syncope.

High Risk: Features include WHO Functional Class IV (symptoms at rest), recurrent syncope, and signs of right heart failure (CI < 2.0 L/min/m², hypotension). Current guidelines (ESC/ERS) recommend initial triple therapy including an IV prostacyclin (e.g., epoprostenol) for high-risk patients.\n2.  Intermediate Risk: Features include WHO Functional Class III (symptoms on exertion), no syncope (though \"near-syncope\" is concerning), and moderately impaired hemodynamics. Guidelines strongly recommend initial dual combination therapy (ERA + PDE5i) for intermediate-risk patients to reduce morbidity and hospitalization.\n3.  Low Risk: WHO FC I/II, normal hemodynamics.\n\nThis patient has \"progressive exertional dyspnea\" (likely FC III) and \"near-syncope\" but maintains a stable blood pressure (108/68 mmHg) and resting oxygen saturation. While her CI is borderline (2.0), she does not exhibit the overt shock or rest symptoms typically required to mandate immediate IV epoprostenol as the *initial* strategy in a multiple-choice context, particularly when oral dual therapy is the established standard for symptomatic PAH (AMBITION trial). The AMBITION trial demonstrated that initial combination therapy with ambrisentan and tadalafil was superior to monotherapy in reducing clinical failure in patients with FC II and III PAH.\n\nRegarding the other options:\n*   (A): Calcium channel blockers (e.g., amlodipine) are indicated only for patients with a positive acute vasoreactivity test. Patients with CTD-associated PAH are rarely vasoreactive, and CCBs are contraindicated in the presence of right heart failure/instability.\n*   (C): Initial triple therapy with IV epoprostenol is generally reserved for patients presenting in high-risk (FC IV) conditions or cardiogenic shock. While this patient is severe, the standard initial step for her presentation (FC III, stable BP) is aggressive dual oral therapy.\n*   (D) & (E): Monotherapy is generally considered inferior to combination therapy for patients with this degree of symptomatic disease and hemodynamic impairment.\n*   Pregnancy: Pregnancy is contraindicated in PAH due to high maternal mortality. While ERAs (Ambrisentan) are teratogenic, the immediate priority is stabilizing the mother's life-threatening condition. Strict contraception is required.

She has failed outpatient management with first-line (pyridoxine/doxylamine) and second-line (promethazine) agents.\n\nManagement reasoning:\n1.  Admission decision: Despite the patient's request to avoid hospitalization, her clinical condition (severe hypokalemia, orthostasis, failure of outpatient meds, inability to tolerate oral intake) necessitates admission for stabilization, aggressive IV fluid/electrolyte replacement, and parenteral antiemetic therapy. Discharging a patient with K 2.9 mEq/L and ongoing nausea is unsafe.\n2.  Pharmacologic Management:\n    *   Option A (Oral Ondansetron, Discharge): The patient cannot keep down oral medications. Discharging her on oral meds is likely to result in treatment failure and readmission.\n    *   Option B (SQ Metoclopramide, Outpatient): While subcutaneous pumps are a valid management tool for HG, initiating this as an outpatient in a patient with significant metabolic derangement and instability is inappropriate. Stabilization is the priority.\n    *   Option C (IV Ondansetron, Admit, TPN): Admission and IV ondansetron are correct, but Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) is considered a last resort after failure of enteral feeding (tube feeding). Initiating TPN via PICC line at this stage is overly aggressive and carries significant risks (infection, thrombosis).\n    *   Option D (Scopolamine/Mirtazapine): Not standard next-line rescue therapies for severe acute HG.\n    *   Option E (IV Chlorpromazine, Admit, Transition to IV Ondansetron/Metoclopramide): This is the most appropriate choice. Admission allows for safety. Chlorpromazine (a phenothiazine) is often used as a third-line or rescue agent in a hospital setting for refractory cases (cocktails often include it or droperidol). Transitioning to scheduled IV antiemetics (like ondansetron or metoclopramide) ensures a sustained effect while bypassing the oral route. This plan addresses the severity of the condition and the route of administration issue.\n\nRegarding the patient's anxiety about teratogens: While she is anxious, the medical necessity of treating severe maternal malnutrition and electrolyte imbalance takes precedence. Chlorpromazine and Metoclopramide have long safety records. Ondansetron is also widely used and risks are low, especially after 10 weeks (patient is 11 weeks).

The differential diagnosis includes dilated cardiomyopathy of idiopathic, viral (myocarditis), or genetic/metabolic etiology. ALCAPA is ruled out by normal coronary origins.\n\nThe management of infants with severe DCM (EF 20%) and failure to thrive involves aggressive medical therapy and potentially heart transplantation.\n1.  Medical Therapy: The goal is to stabilize and reverse remodeling. However, the mortality rate for infants with symptomatic DCM is high, particularly in the first few months after diagnosis.\n2.  Transplantation Listing: Due to the high risk of sudden death, rapid decompensation, and the scarcity of donor organs (resulting in long wait times and high waitlist mortality), guidelines and common practice support early listing for heart transplantation in infants who require continuous inotropic support (like milrinone), even if they are currently \"stable.\" This allows for the accrual of waiting time. If the patient recovers ventricular function (which occurs in a significant percentage of infants, particularly with myocarditis), they can be removed from the list (\"delisted\").\n3.  Status 1A: In pediatric heart allocation, infants who are admitted to the hospital and require continuous intravenous inotropes (like milrinone) generally qualify for Status 1A (or the highest urgency tier depending on specific country guidelines/eras), reflecting the high medical urgency.\n\nLet's evaluate the distractors:\n*   Option A: While weaning inotropes and transitioning to oral medications is the goal of medical therapy, setting a specific EF threshold (>35%) and committing to \"oral heart failure therapy *only*\" ignores the high risk of mortality and the potential need for a backup plan (transplant) if recovery does not occur. Delaying listing until \"failure\" is proven can be fatal due to wait times.\n*   Option C: IVIG is sometimes used for myocarditis or Kawasaki disease, but evidence for routine use in all DCM/presumed myocarditis is not definitive. More importantly, \"deferring consideration of mechanical support\" is unsafe in a patient with severe heart failure who may deteriorate.\n*   Option D: Durable LVADs (e.g., Berlin Heart) are used in infants as a bridge to transplant, but they are associated with significant morbidity (stroke, infection). Since the patient is currently stable on milrinone, escalating to a VAD is not the immediate next step. VAD evaluation is typically reserved for patients failing medical management.\n*   Option E: The mitral regurgitation is functional, secondary to LV dilation. Surgical repair of the valve does not address the underlying myocardial failure and carries high risk. Treatment of the heart failure typically reduces the regurgitation.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate definitive management planning step, acknowledging the high mortality and the need for a safety net while medical therapy is given time to work, is to list for transplant.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed126", "question_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed126-008", "question": "A 29-year-old woman at 36+1 weeks with known SLE (class IV lupus nephritis in remission on azathioprine and hydroxychloroquine) presents with 3 days of severe frontal headache, visual blurring, and increasing lower extremity edema.

The treatment strategy differs significantly from idiopathic (ANCA-negative) PAN.\n\n1.  Antiviral Therapy: Use of potent antivirals (like entecavir or tenofovir) is critical to suppress viral replication and halt the production of viral antigens.\n2.  Plasma Exchange (Plasmapheresis): This is used to rapidly remove circulating immune complexes and is a cornerstone of therapy for HBV-associated PAN, aiming to facilitate seroconversion (HBeAg to anti-HBe).\n3.  Corticosteroids: While prolonged immunosuppression is avoided to prevent enhanced viral replication and chronic carrier states, initial short-term high-dose corticosteroids are often indicated, especially in patients with severe, life-threatening, or organ-threatening manifestations (such as mononeuritis multiplex, severe renal involvement, or severe hypertension), to control acute inflammation. They are typically tapered rapidly (e.g., over 2 weeks).\n4.  Avoidance of Cytotoxic Immunosuppression: Agents like cyclophosphamide (Option A) are generally contraindicated or avoided because they suppress the immune response required for seroconversion and viral clearance, potentially leading to chronic active hepatitis or liver failure. They are reserved for cases refractory to standard HBV-PAN therapy.\n\nOption Analysis:\n*   A: Standard therapy for idiopathic PAN but dangerous for HBV-PAN due to lack of antivirals and use of cyclophosphamide.\n*   B: Delaying treatment is inappropriate given the severe active vasculitis (nerve damage).\n*   C: This option includes high-dose corticosteroids (necessary for the acute severe mononeuritis/renal ischemia) combined with plasma exchange (to clear complexes) and antiviral therapy (to treat the underlying physiological cause). This aligns with guidelines for treating severe HBV-associated vasculitis.\n*   D: Rituximab is not the standard first-line treatment and could cause severe HBV reactivation.\n*   E: While \"avoiding immunosuppression\" is a key principle (referring mainly to cyclophosphamide), using PE and entecavir \"only\" omits the corticosteroids necessary to control the acute severe inflammation causing the foot drop and renal injury.\n\nTherefore, the most comprehensive and appropriate strategy for this severe presentation is the combination of steroids, plasma exchange, and antivirals.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}]
