CT angiography shows an acute Stanford type B aortic dissection starting distal to the left subclavian artery and extending to the infrarenal aorta with involvement of the origin of the left renal artery, but no signs of rupture or pericardial effusion. The left kidney is perfused via a narrowed true lumen; creatinine is 1.4 mg/dL (baseline 1.0).
