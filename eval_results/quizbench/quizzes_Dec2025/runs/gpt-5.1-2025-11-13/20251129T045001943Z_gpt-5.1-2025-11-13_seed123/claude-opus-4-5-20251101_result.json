Surgical TVR: High surgical risk given severe LV dysfunction (LVEF 20%), RV dysfunction, and the patient's overall condition. Surgical mortality would be prohibitive.\n\nB. Catheter-based edge-to-edge TR repair: This is a less invasive option for severe TR. However, the patient has significant RV dysfunction (TAPSE 1.0, FAC 25%), and outcomes with transcatheter TR repair are generally poor when RV function is severely impaired. The TRILUMINATE trial showed benefits mainly in patients with better RV function.\n\nC. Isolated LVAD: This patient has severe biventricular failure. The RV dysfunction (TAPSE 1.0, FAC 25%) is significant. Isolated LVAD in patients with RV dysfunction has high risk of RV failure post-implant. However, LVAD can potentially unload the LV, reduce pulmonary pressures, and improve RV function over time. The TR is functional/secondary, likely related to RV dilation from LV failure. LVAD could address the root cause.\n\nD. CRT-D with AV node ablation: Patient is in sinus rhythm, so AV node ablation is not indicated. CRT might be considered if he has LBBB and wide QRS, but this isn't mentioned, and AV node ablation in sinus rhythm is inappropriate.\n\nE. Sacubitril/valsartan uptitration: BP is 88/54 - already hypotensive. Uptitrating neurohormonal blockade would likely cause further hypotension and is not feasible.\n\nBest Answer:\nGiven the severe LV dysfunction as the primary driver, functional TR secondary to RV dilation from LV failure, and the patient being symptomatic despite GDMT, LVAD implantation addresses the underlying cause. While RV dysfunction is a concern, the moderate PASP suggests the RV dysfunction may improve with LV unloading. This is the most appropriate option to improve outcomes in a non-transplant candidate with end-stage heart failure.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed123", "question_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed123-002", "question": "A 41-year-old woman presents with progressive exertional dyspnea and chest tightness.

However, BRAO can also occur from local atherosclerotic disease, though MRA shows no significant carotid stenosis.\n\n2. Current anticoagulation status: He's on appropriate-dose apixaban for AFib stroke prevention and reports strict adherence. Despite this, he had an embolic event.\n\n3. Options analysis:\n\n   - Option A (Add aspirin): Adding aspirin to anticoagulation increases bleeding risk significantly. The AUGUSTUS trial and others show that adding antiplatelet therapy to anticoagulation should be minimized. This is generally not recommended long-term unless there's a specific indication like recent ACS/PCI.\n\n   - Option B (Switch to warfarin INR 2.5-3.5): Higher-intensity anticoagulation is typically reserved for mechanical heart valves. DOACs are non-inferior to warfarin for AFib, and there's no evidence that switching to higher-intensity warfarin would be beneficial.\n\n   - Option C (Continue same regimen): The patient had a breakthrough event on appropriate anticoagulation. However, breakthrough events can occur even with optimal therapy. The standard dose is appropriate, and there's no evidence that changing the regimen would prevent future events.\n\n   - Option D (Increase apixaban dose): 10 mg BID is not a standard or approved dose for stroke prevention in AFib. This would increase bleeding risk without proven benefit.\n\n   - Option E (Switch to DAPT): Discontinuing anticoagulation in a patient with AFib would significantly increase stroke risk. DAPT is inferior to anticoagulation for AFib-related stroke prevention.\n\nConclusion: Despite the breakthrough event, the patient is on appropriate guideline-directed therapy. Breakthrough events can occur, but there's no evidence-based strategy to intensify therapy that would provide net clinical benefit. The most appropriate approach is to continue the current regimen.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed123", "question_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed123-009", "question": "A 46-year-old man presents with sudden severe tearing chest pain radiating to the back.

Dantrolene - Used for malignant hyperthermia and sometimes NMS (which has rigidity). Not indicated for serotonin syndrome as the mechanism is different.\n\nB. Cyproheptadine - This is a serotonin antagonist (5-HT2A antagonist) and is the specific antidote for serotonin syndrome. Note: It's only available orally, so it would be given via NG tube as crushed tablets, not truly \"IV.\" However, this is the correct pharmacologic intervention for refractory serotonin syndrome.\n\nC. Nitroprusside - Only addresses blood pressure, not the underlying syndrome or hyperthermia.\n\nD. Dexmedetomidine - An alpha-2 agonist sedative. While it can help with agitation, it doesn't address the serotonergic mechanism and isn't first-line for serotonin syndrome.\n\nE. Bromocriptine - A dopamine agonist used for NMS, which would be contraindicated in serotonin syndrome as it could worsen symptoms.\n\nBest Answer: Cyproheptadine is the specific treatment for serotonin syndrome refractory to benzodiazepines.
