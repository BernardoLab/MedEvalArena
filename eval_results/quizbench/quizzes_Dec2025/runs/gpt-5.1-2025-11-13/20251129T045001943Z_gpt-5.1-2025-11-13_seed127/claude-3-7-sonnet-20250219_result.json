Hip exam reveals extreme pain with any passive motion, especially internal rotation, and the leg is slightly flexed and externally rotated. WBC 18,000/µL, CRP 14 mg/dL, ESR 86 mm/h. Plain radiograph is unremarkable. MRI of the pelvis obtained within 6 hours of symptom onset shows bone marrow edema of the femoral head and neck with a moderate hip joint effusion, but no definite abscess or cortical destruction. Which is the most appropriate next step?", "options": ["Treat as vaso-occlusive crisis with IV opioids and observe for 24-48 hours", "Start broad-spectrum IV antibiotics and schedule urgent surgical hip drainage", "Obtain radionuclide bone scan to differentiate infarction from osteomyelitis", "Repeat pelvic MRI with contrast in 72 hours before deciding on surgery", "Start IV antibiotics and aspirate the hip joint under ultrasound guidance"], "answer": "E", "answer_index": 4, "explanation": "In children with sickle cell disease, distinguishing osteomyelitis/septic arthritis from bone infarction is challenging; fever, high inflammatory markers, inability to bear weight, and effusion demand prompt evaluation. Joint aspiration with culture, ideally under ultrasound guidance, plus empiric IV antibiotics is the appropriate next step to diagnose or exclude septic arthritis early. Delaying for observation or repeat imaging risks joint destruction; bone scan is nonspecific in this setting, and immediate surgical drainage without diagnostic aspiration may be premature without frank clinical sepsis.", "generator_model": "gpt-5.1-2025-11-13", "seed": 127, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "pred": "E", "model_outputs": "To determine the most appropriate next step for this 7-year-old boy with sickle cell disease presenting with acute hip pain, I need to analyze the clinical presentation and diagnostic findings.\n\nKey clinical features:\n- Severe left hip pain with inability to bear weight\n- Fever (38.3°C)\n- Tachycardia (HR 120/min)\n- Extreme pain with passive motion, especially internal rotation\n- Leg slightly flexed and externally rotated\n- Elevated inflammatory markers (WBC 18,000/µL, CRP 14 mg/dL, ESR 86 mm/h)\n- MRI showing bone marrow edema and hip joint effusion\n\nThis presentation is concerning for septic arthritis and/or osteomyelitis rather than a simple vaso-occlusive crisis. The combination of fever, elevated inflammatory markers, and MRI findings of joint effusion strongly suggest an infectious process. Patients with sickle cell disease are at increased risk for osteomyelitis, particularly from Salmonella and Staphylococcus.\n\nGiven the high suspicion for infection, option B (starting antibiotics and surgical drainage) would be appropriate if there was a definite abscess, but the MRI doesn't show a definite abscess.\n\nOption A (treating as vaso-occlusive crisis) would be inappropriate given the fever and significantly elevated inflammatory markers.\n\nOption C (bone scan) would not add significant value after an MRI has already been performed.\n\nOption D (repeating MRI in 72 hours) would delay treatment of a potential infection.\n\nOption E (starting IV antibiotics and aspirating the hip joint) is the most appropriate next step. This approach addresses the likely infectious process with antibiotics while obtaining joint fluid for culture to guide definitive therapy.\n\nThe answer is (E)"}]
