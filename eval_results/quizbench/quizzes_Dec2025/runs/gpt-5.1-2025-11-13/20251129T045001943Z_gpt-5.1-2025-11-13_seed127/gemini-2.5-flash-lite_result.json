BP is 118/66 mm Hg, BMI 31 kg/m², A1c 7.2%. eGFR is 37 mL/min/1.73 m², urinary ACR 620 mg/g (persistent over 9 months), potassium 4.6 mEq/L. He has no hyperkalemia history.

He also has significant albuminuria (ACR 620 mg/g) and is already on an SGLT2 inhibitor (empagliflozin) and an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril), which are standard therapies for cardiorenal risk reduction in this population. His A1c is 7.2%, which is at the upper limit of the target for many patients with diabetes and CKD.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Increase empagliflozin to 25 mg daily: While increasing the dose of empagliflozin might offer some additional benefit, the maximum approved dose for cardiorenal protection is typically 10 mg daily in patients with CKD. Higher doses are not standard for this indication and may not provide significant additional benefit for cardiorenal risk reduction beyond what is already achieved at 10 mg.\n\nB. Add finerenone with close potassium monitoring: Finerenone is a non-steroidal MRA that has demonstrated significant cardiorenal benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD, particularly those with albuminuria, even when on standard therapies like SGLT2 inhibitors and RAAS inhibitors. Given the patient's persistent albuminuria and CKD, finerenone is a strong candidate to further reduce cardiorenal risk. Close potassium monitoring is necessary, but the patient has no history of hyperkalemia and his current potassium is normal.\n\nC. Replace lisinopril with sacubitril/valsartan: Sacubitril/valsartan is indicated for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and hypertension. While it can have some renal benefits, it is not the primary agent for reducing cardiorenal risk in a patient with diabetes and CKD and albuminuria who is already on an ACE inhibitor. The benefit of switching from an ACE inhibitor to sacubitril/valsartan in this specific context for cardiorenal risk reduction is less established than adding finerenone.\n\nD. Add basal insulin to target A1c <6.5%: While achieving a lower A1c can be beneficial, the patient's A1c of 7.2% is not excessively high, especially considering his age, CKD, and history of NSTEMI. Aggressively lowering A1c with insulin in a patient with CKD can increase the risk of hypoglycemia and may not be the most effective strategy for cardiorenal risk reduction compared to agents specifically targeting the underlying pathophysiology of diabetic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, the current A1c is not the primary driver of his significant albuminuria.\n\nE. Add a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker: Calcium channel blockers are primarily used for blood pressure control and are not specifically indicated for reducing cardiorenal risk in the context of diabetic kidney disease and albuminuria beyond their antihypertensive effects. They do not offer the same targeted cardiorenal protection as SGLT2 inhibitors or MRAs.\n\nConsidering the patient's persistent albuminuria and CKD, finerenone is the most appropriate addition to his current regimen to further reduce cardiorenal risk. It targets the mineralocorticoid receptor pathway, which plays a significant role in the progression of diabetic kidney disease and cardiovascular events.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed127", "question_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed127-002", "question": "A 4-year-old boy is brought to the ED with 2 days of fever, abdominal pain, and vomiting.

His history of Kawasaki disease with a giant coronary artery aneurysm, even though it has regressed, raises concern for a recurrence or a complication related to his underlying vasculitis.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Re-treat with high-dose IVIG and start high-dose aspirin: While IVIG is a cornerstone of Kawasaki disease treatment, it's typically used for acute, untreated or incompletely treated disease, or for recalcitrant cases. Given the patient's history and current presentation, it's not the immediate priority without further investigation into the cause of his current illness. High-dose aspirin is also part of acute Kawasaki treatment.\n\nB. Obtain emergent coronary CT angiography and start IV heparin: The patient has a history of coronary artery aneurysms, and the current presentation with shock and ECG changes raises concern for cardiac involvement, potentially including thrombosis or inflammation of the coronary arteries. Coronary CT angiography would be crucial to assess the current state of his coronary arteries, especially given his history. Heparin would be indicated if there is evidence of thrombosis.\n\nC. Start IV milrinone and low-dose aspirin without additional imaging: Milrinone is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor used for heart failure and cardiogenic shock. While the patient has mild LV dysfunction, the primary concern is the underlying cause of his illness and potential cardiac involvement. Low-dose aspirin is typically for long-term antiplatelet therapy in patients with coronary aneurysms, not necessarily the immediate treatment for an acute, undiagnosed illness.\n\nD. Start IV methylprednisolone plus IVIG and transfer for ECMO standby: Methylprednisolone is a potent anti-inflammatory, and IVIG is used for Kawasaki disease. However, starting these without a clear diagnosis of recurrent Kawasaki disease or another inflammatory condition that warrants such aggressive immunosuppression might be premature. ECMO standby is for severe refractory shock, which this patient may be progressing towards, but the immediate step should focus on diagnosis.\n\nE. Begin norepinephrine for septic shock and defer cardiac-specific therapy: The patient is in shock, and sepsis is a strong possibility given the fever and ill appearance. Norepinephrine is appropriate for septic shock. However, deferring cardiac-specific therapy entirely might be dangerous given his history of coronary aneurysms and the current ECG changes and mild LV dysfunction. The question asks for the *most appropriate* next step. While treating shock is critical, ignoring the potential cardiac implications in a patient with this history would be a mistake.\n\nConsidering the patient's history of Kawasaki disease and coronary aneurysms, the current presentation of shock, and ECG changes, the most prudent next step is to investigate the coronary arteries to rule out complications like thrombosis or active vasculitis. Coronary CT angiography is the best modality for this. If thrombosis is found, heparin would be indicated.

The absence of anti-phospholipid antibodies rules out antiphospholipid syndrome. The confirmed pregnancy at 6 weeks gestation is a critical factor in treatment selection.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Start high-dose prednisone plus mycophenolate mofetil: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is generally avoided in the first trimester of pregnancy due to teratogenicity. High-dose prednisone might be considered for severe flares, but MMF is not the initial choice in early pregnancy.\n\nB. Start hydroxychloroquine and low-moderate dose prednisone: Hydroxychloroquine is considered safe and beneficial in pregnancy for SLE, helping to control disease activity and prevent flares. Low to moderate dose prednisone is also generally considered safe in pregnancy for managing SLE symptoms, especially when hydroxychloroquine alone is insufficient. This combination addresses the inflammatory and autoimmune components of SLE while minimizing risks to the fetus.\n\nC. Start methotrexate and high-dose NSAIDs: Methotrexate is a potent teratogen and is absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy. High-dose NSAIDs can also pose risks in pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester, and are not the primary treatment for moderate SLE flares.\n\nD. Defer immunosuppression and treat with low-dose aspirin alone: While low-dose aspirin might be used for prophylaxis against preeclampsia in pregnant women with SLE, it is insufficient to manage active SLE flares with significant organ involvement (pleuritis, effusions, cytopenias).\n\nE. Start belimumab and discontinue hydroxychloroquine once controlled: Belimumab is a biologic agent that can be effective in SLE, but its safety profile in pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, is not as well-established as hydroxychloroquine and prednisone. Discontinuing hydroxychloroquine would be counterproductive as it is a cornerstone of SLE management in pregnancy.\n\nConsidering the patient's active SLE symptoms and her early pregnancy, the most appropriate initial strategy is to use medications with a favorable safety profile in pregnancy. Hydroxychloroquine is a safe and effective long-term treatment for SLE and is recommended during pregnancy.

However, the nuclear perfusion imaging shows normal perfusion, which is a significant finding. Coronary CT angiography reveals a myocardial bridge with significant systolic compression of the LAD.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Starting high-dose beta-blocker therapy is a reasonable approach for managing symptoms of exertional ischemia, especially in the context of a myocardial bridge, as it reduces myocardial oxygen demand. However, given the discrepancy between the treadmill test and the nuclear imaging, and the significant systolic compression seen on CT, simply starting medication without further investigation might not be the best next step.\n\nB. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of a myocardial bridge is generally not recommended due to the risk of restenosis and the potential for long-term complications. Myocardial bridges are dynamic lesions, and stenting can lead to issues with stent malapposition or fracture.\n\nC. Invasive coronary angiography is the gold standard for assessing coronary anatomy. Performing it with pressure-wire assessment (fractional flow reserve - FFR) during dobutamine stress can help determine the functional significance of the myocardial bridge. Dobutamine stress can mimic the physiological stress that causes symptoms and can unmask ischemia if the bridge is functionally significant, even if resting or standard stress perfusion imaging was normal. This approach directly addresses the potential hemodynamic impact of the myocardial bridge.\n\nD. Surgical myotomy is a treatment option for symptomatic myocardial bridges that are refractory to medical management. However, it is an invasive procedure and is typically considered after less invasive methods have been explored or failed.\n\nE. Reassuring the patient and discontinuing follow-up is not appropriate given the exertional symptoms and the finding of a significant myocardial bridge, even with normal nuclear imaging. The discrepancy between the treadmill test and nuclear imaging suggests that the functional significance of the bridge needs further evaluation.\n\nConsidering the options, invasive coronary angiography with pressure-wire assessment during dobutamine stress (option C) offers the most comprehensive approach to determine the functional significance of the myocardial bridge and guide further management. While beta-blockers (option A) are a treatment, they are best initiated after confirming the functional significance of the ischemia.

She has already received a magnesium sulfate loading dose, which is the first-line treatment for seizure control in eclampsia.\n\nAfter stabilizing the airway and breathing, the immediate priorities are to control the severe hypertension and prevent further seizures.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Administer an additional 2-g IV magnesium bolus and start IV labetalol. Magnesium sulfate is continued for seizure prophylaxis. Labetalol is a first-line antihypertensive agent for severe hypertension in preeclampsia/eclampsia. This addresses both seizure prevention and blood pressure control.\n\nB. Start continuous propofol infusion and emergent head CT before antihypertensives. Propofol is generally not the first-line treatment for eclamptic seizures; magnesium sulfate is preferred. An emergent head CT is not typically indicated in uncomplicated eclampsia unless there are concerns for other neurological pathology. Antihypertensives are crucial and should not be delayed.\n\nC. Give IV levetiracetam, discontinue magnesium, and proceed to emergent cesarean delivery. Levetiracetam is an alternative anticonvulsant, but magnesium sulfate is the standard of care. Discontinuing magnesium prematurely is not appropriate. While emergent delivery might be considered, immediate antihypertensive management and continued seizure prophylaxis are paramount.\n\nD. Start nicardipine infusion targeting BP <120/80 mm Hg and delay delivery for 48 hours. Nicardipine is an acceptable antihypertensive, but targeting a BP of <120/80 mm Hg might be too aggressive initially in a pregnant patient with eclampsia, and the goal is usually to lower it to a safer range (e.g., <160/110 mm Hg) while avoiding rapid drops. Delaying delivery for 48 hours is not appropriate given the severity of her condition and the risk of further complications.\n\nE. Administer IV diazepam and begin oral labetalol once she awakens. Diazepam can be used as a second-line agent for seizures if magnesium is ineffective, but it's not the initial choice. Oral labetalol is less effective than IV for rapid blood pressure control in this acute setting.\n\nConsidering the patient has already received a magnesium loading dose, continuing magnesium and initiating IV antihypertensives are the most critical next steps.

Whole-body MRI is a powerful imaging tool, but it's generally not the first-line investigation for diffuse musculoskeletal pain without clear signs of inflammation or specific joint involvement. While it can detect enthesitis, the absence of significant inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP) and the diffuse nature of the pain make this less likely to be the most appropriate initial step. Occult malignancy is also less likely given the normal CBC and lack of other red flags like weight loss or fever.\n\nB. Juvenile fibromyalgia is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and cognitive difficulties, often in the absence of objective findings on physical exam or laboratory tests. The patient's symptoms (diffuse musculoskeletal pain, morning stiffness, fatigue, avoidance of activity, fragmented sleep, difficulty focusing, abdominal pain) and normal lab results (including inflammatory markers and CK) strongly align with this diagnosis.

The HRCT findings are classic for a usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern, which is the hallmark of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Given her history of seropositive RA and current immunosuppressive medications, the UIP pattern is highly concerning for rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD) with a UIP pattern.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Discontinue methotrexate permanently and increase adalimumab dose: Methotrexate is a common cause of drug-induced lung disease, but the HRCT findings are more consistent with UIP, which is less likely to be directly caused by methotrexate in this pattern. While methotrexate can contribute to ILD, stopping it might not be the primary or most effective intervention for established UIP. Increasing adalimumab, a TNF inhibitor, could potentially worsen ILD in some cases, although it's also used to treat RA.\n\nB. Continue current RA regimen and add nintedanib: Nintedanib is an antifibrotic medication approved for the treatment of IPF and progressive fibrosing ILDs, including RA-ILD with a UIP pattern. It has been shown to slow disease progression. Continuing her current RA medications is reasonable as they are controlling her RA, and the focus needs to be on the progressive ILD.\n\nC.

While it can be used in RA-ILD, there's no strong evidence to suggest it's superior to continuing current therapy and adding an antifibrotic for UIP pattern ILD. Stopping adalimumab without a clear indication might destabilize her RA.\n\nD. Stop methotrexate and adalimumab, and start high-dose prednisone plus azathioprine: High-dose prednisone and azathioprine are generally not recommended for UIP pattern ILD, as they can be ineffective and carry significant side effects. In fact, steroids can sometimes worsen fibrosis. This approach is more typical for other forms of ILD that are responsive to immunosuppression.\n\nE. Add mycophenolate mofetil to current regimen for treatment of ILD: Mycophenolate mofetil is an immunosuppressant that can be used for some forms of ILD. However, for UIP pattern ILD, antifibrotic therapy like nintedanib is the preferred approach to slow progression. While mycophenolate might be considered in specific scenarios or for non-UIP ILDs, it's not the first-line treatment for established UIP.\n\nConsidering the UIP pattern on HRCT and the progressive nature of her lung disease, the most appropriate management is to address the fibrosis directly. Nintedanib is the evidence-based treatment for slowing the progression of fibrosing ILDs with a UIP pattern, including RA-ILD. Continuing her current RA regimen is important for managing her underlying RA.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed127", "question_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed127-008", "question": "A 45-year-old man with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (A1c 10.8%), BMI 36 kg/m², and mild nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy presents for follow-up.

Liraglutide:** This is a GLP-1 receptor agonist. It is effective for glucose lowering and weight loss. It can also help lower triglycerides.\n*   **B. Semaglutide:** This is also a GLP-1 receptor agonist, generally considered more potent than liraglutide for both glucose lowering and weight loss. It has demonstrated significant cardiovascular benefits and is approved for weight management.\n*   **C. Dulaglutide:** This is another GLP-1 receptor agonist. While effective for glucose control, its weight loss effect is generally less pronounced than semaglutide or liraglutide, and it is not specifically approved for weight management.\n*   **D. Tirzepatide:** This is a dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist. It has shown superior efficacy in glucose lowering and weight loss compared to GLP-1 receptor agonists alone. It is a strong candidate for this patient given his goals.\n*   **E. Empagliflozin:** This is an SGLT2 inhibitor.

However, tirzepatide has demonstrated the most significant weight loss and glucose-lowering effects among the available options. Given the patient's high BMI and A1c, a therapy with the greatest potential for both would be most appropriate.\n\nThe patient has a history of pancreatitis attributed to severe hypertriglyceridemia. While GLP-1 receptor agonists and tirzepatide can help lower triglycerides, it's important to note that some studies have shown a potential increased risk of pancreatitis with GLP-1 receptor agonists, although this is often in the context of pre-existing risk factors or very high doses. However, the patient's triglycerides are currently controlled with fenofibrate. The primary drivers for choosing a new agent here are weight loss and improved glycemic control.\n\nComparing semaglutide and tirzepatide, tirzepatide has shown greater efficacy in both weight loss and A1c reduction in clinical trials.

The sudden collapse during exercise, family history of sudden cardiac death in a young relative, and the development of polymorphic VT during exercise stress testing are highly concerning. The prolonged QTc in recovery (510 ms) with late-appearing T waves in V2-V4 is characteristic of a repolarization abnormality.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Implant an ICD and start high-dose beta-blocker therapy: While an ICD is indicated for patients with significant ventricular arrhythmias and risk of sudden cardiac death, starting high-dose beta-blockers is also a crucial part of management for certain inherited arrhythmia syndromes. However, the diagnosis is not yet definitively established, and other options might be more appropriate as a *next* step.\n\nB. Start nadolol and schedule left cardiac sympathetic denervation: Nadolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that is particularly effective in managing catecholaminergic polymorphic VT (CPVT). Left cardiac sympathetic denervation is a surgical option for refractory CPVT. However, genetic testing should ideally precede definitive treatment like denervation.\n\nC. Start flecainide in addition to beta-blocker therapy: Flecainide is a Class Ic antiarrhythmic. While it can be used in some channelopathies, it is generally not the first-line treatment for conditions like CPVT and can sometimes worsen arrhythmias in certain contexts.\n\nD. Begin verapamil and restrict participation to low-intensity sports: Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker. While calcium channel blockers can be used in some forms of long QT syndrome, they are not the primary treatment for CPVT, and restricting sports participation without a definitive diagnosis might be premature.\n\nE. Perform genetic testing for catecholaminergic polymorphic VT before any therapy: Given the clinical presentation (exercise-induced polymorphic VT, family history of sudden death), CPVT is a strong consideration. Genetic testing is the definitive diagnostic tool for CPVT, which is caused by mutations in genes encoding cardiac ryanodine receptors (RYR2) or calsequestrin (CASQ2). Identifying the genetic mutation can guide therapy and family screening. Performing genetic testing *before* initiating potentially irreversible or invasive treatments is the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis and tailor management.\n\nThe ECG findings in recovery (prolonged QTc, late-appearing T waves) are suggestive of a repolarization abnormality, and the exercise-induced polymorphic VT strongly points towards CPVT. Therefore, confirming this diagnosis with genetic testing is paramount.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{E}$."}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed127", "question_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed127-010", "question": "A 7-year-old boy with sickle cell disease (HbSS) presents with acute onset of severe left hip pain and inability to bear weight.
