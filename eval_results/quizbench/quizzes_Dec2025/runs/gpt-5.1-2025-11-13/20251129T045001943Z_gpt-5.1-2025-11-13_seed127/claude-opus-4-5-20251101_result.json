Increase empagliflozin to 25 mg daily\n- The cardiorenal benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors are not dose-dependent for outcomes. The 10 mg dose provides the same cardiovascular and renal protection as 25 mg. This would not add significant benefit.\n\nB. Add finerenone with close potassium monitoring\n- Finerenone is a non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) with proven cardiorenal benefits in diabetic kidney disease (FIDELIO-DKN and FIGARO-DKD trials). It's indicated for patients with T2DM and CKD with albuminuria who are already on maximally tolerated ACEi/ARB. His potassium is 4.6 (acceptable for initiation), and he has no hyperkalemia history. This addresses his persistent significant albuminuria.\n\nC. Replace lisinopril with sacubitril/valsartan\n- Sacubitril/valsartan is indicated for HFrEF. There's no mention of heart failure or reduced EF. His prior NSTEMI doesn't automatically indicate HF. This wouldn't be appropriate without HF indication.\n\nD. Add basal insulin to target A1c <6.5%\n- His A1c of 7.2% is reasonable for someone with CKD and cardiovascular disease. Targeting <6.5% could increase hypoglycemia risk without proven benefit in this population.\n\nE. Add a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker\n- BP is already well-controlled at 118/66. Adding this would risk hypotension and isn't indicated for cardiorenal protection.\n\nBest Answer: Finerenone has demonstrated significant reduction in kidney disease progression and cardiovascular events in patients with T2DM and CKD with albuminuria, on top of ACEi/ARB and SGLT2i therapy.

The \"regression\" is often due to intimal proliferation which can cause stenosis rather than true normalization. This child is presenting with:\n1. Signs of myocardial ischemia (ST depression in LAD territory, troponin elevation)\n2. Cardiogenic shock features (LV dysfunction, hypotension)\n3. Possible sepsis (fever, ill appearance)\n\nAnalysis of Options:\n\nA. IVIG + high-dose aspirin - This would be for acute/recurrent Kawasaki disease. There's no indication this is recurrent KD.\n\nB. Emergent coronary CT angiography + IV heparin - This addresses the concern for coronary thrombosis/stenosis in a patient with known coronary artery disease from KD. The ischemic changes suggest coronary involvement. Heparin would address potential thrombosis.\n\nC. IV milrinone + low-dose aspirin without imaging - Milrinone helps with cardiogenic shock but doesn't address the underlying coronary issue, and avoiding imaging misses the diagnosis.\n\nD. Methylprednisolone + IVIG + ECMO standby - This is aggressive immunotherapy for refractory KD, not indicated here.\n\nE. Norepinephrine for septic shock, defer cardiac therapy - This ignores the clear cardiac findings (ST changes, troponin, LV dysfunction) which suggest the primary problem is cardiac.\n\nBest Answer:\nGiven the history of giant coronary aneurysm, current ischemic ECG changes, troponin elevation, and LV dysfunction, this presentation is most consistent with acute coronary syndrome (likely thrombosis or stenosis in the previously affected LAD). Emergent coronary imaging is essential to define the anatomy, and anticoagulation with heparin is appropriate for suspected coronary thrombosis.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed127", "question_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed127-003", "question": "A 32-year-old woman presents with 3 weeks of migratory polyarthritis, pleuritic chest pain, and low-grade fever.

The myocardial bridge shows systolic compression (which is expected and usually benign since coronary perfusion occurs primarily in diastole) with preserved diastolic lumen.\n\nKey considerations:\n- Myocardial bridges are common (found in 25-30% of autopsies) and usually benign\n- Coronary flow occurs predominantly during diastole, so systolic compression alone rarely causes ischemia\n- The preserved diastolic lumen on CCTA is reassuring\n- Normal nuclear perfusion imaging suggests no significant ischemia\n- The ST changes could be false positive (common with LVH, hypertension)\n\nEvaluating options:\n\nA. High-dose beta-blocker therapy - Beta-blockers are first-line treatment for symptomatic myocardial bridges as they reduce heart rate (prolonging diastole), decrease contractility (reducing systolic compression), and have negative inotropic effects. However, this patient has normal perfusion imaging suggesting the bridge is not causing significant ischemia.\n\nB. PCI with stenting - Generally contraindicated for myocardial bridges due to high rates of stent fracture and restenosis.\n\nC. Invasive angiography with pressure-wire during dobutamine stress - This would be appropriate if there's uncertainty about whether the bridge is causing hemodynamically significant ischemia, but given normal perfusion imaging, this seems excessive.\n\nD. Surgical myotomy - Reserved for refractory cases with proven ischemia.\n\nE. Reassure and no follow-up - Given normal perfusion imaging and preserved diastolic lumen, the myocardial bridge is likely an incidental finding. The ST changes are likely false positive (LVH can cause this). However, the patient does have symptoms.\n\nGiven the patient has symptoms (exertional dyspnea, occasional chest tightness) and a myocardial bridge was found, even though perfusion is normal, a trial of beta-blocker therapy is reasonable as it addresses both the hypertension and could help if the bridge contributes to symptoms.

GLP-1 receptor agonists (A, B, C) and GIP/GLP-1 agonist (D): All are effective for weight loss and glucose control. However, there's a concern about pancreatitis history.\n\n2. Pancreatitis history: GLP-1 RAs have been associated with potential increased risk of pancreatitis, though data is conflicting. The FDA labels for all GLP-1 RAs include warnings about pancreatitis. However, his pancreatitis was attributed to severe hypertriglyceridemia (TG 1,800), not medication-induced. His triglycerides are now controlled.\n\n3. SGLT2 inhibitor (E - Empagliflozin): \n   - Safe with history of pancreatitis\n   - Provides cardiovascular and renal protection\n   - Helps with weight loss (though less than GLP-1 RAs)\n   - Beneficial for fatty liver disease\n   - Safe at eGFR 65\n   - Does not carry pancreatitis risk\n\n4. Diabetic retinopathy concern: Semaglutide has been associated with worsening of diabetic retinopathy in some studies (SUSTAIN-6), particularly with rapid glucose lowering. This is a relative concern.\n\nDecision:\nGiven the history of acute pancreatitis (even though attributed to hypertriglyceridemia), using a GLP-1 RA or tirzepatide carries theoretical risk. The safest choice that still provides weight loss benefit, glucose control, and has additional benefits for his fatty liver and kidney protection would be Empagliflozin (SGLT2 inhibitor).\n\nWhile the patient wants injectable therapy, the history of pancreatitis makes GLP-1 RAs relatively contraindicated or at least a concern.

Observe as VOC - Too risky. The clinical picture (joint effusion, positioning, fever) suggests septic arthritis, which is a surgical emergency. Delay can lead to joint destruction.\n\nB. Antibiotics + urgent surgical drainage - This assumes septic arthritis but skips diagnostic aspiration.\n\nC. Bone scan - Not helpful acutely; both infarction and infection can show increased uptake. Delays treatment.\n\nD. Repeat MRI in 72 hours - Dangerous delay if septic arthritis is present.\n\nE. IV antibiotics + hip aspiration - This is the standard approach. Joint aspiration is both diagnostic (confirms septic arthritis, identifies organism) and therapeutic. In sickle cell patients, Salmonella and Staphylococcus are common pathogens.\n\nThe presence of joint effusion with classic septic hip signs mandates urgent aspiration. This confirms the diagnosis and guides antibiotic therapy. Starting empiric antibiotics while obtaining the aspirate is appropriate given the clinical severity.\n\nThe answer is (E)"}]
