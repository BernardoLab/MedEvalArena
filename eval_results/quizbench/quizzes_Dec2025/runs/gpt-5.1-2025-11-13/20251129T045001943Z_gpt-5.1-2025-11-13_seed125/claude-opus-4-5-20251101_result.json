Despite volume resuscitation, blood products, and endoscopic band ligation, he requires increasing vasopressor doses. Continuous renal replacement therapy is initiated for worsening azotemia and hyperkalemia. His MAP is 62 mm Hg on norepinephrine 0.24 mcg/kg/min and vasopressin 0.03 units/min. Lactate is 5.1 mmol/L; pH 7.28; ScvO2 76%. Bedside echo shows hyperdynamic LV function, small underfilled LV, and collapsible IVC. CVP is 4 mm Hg. You are considering adding a third agent. Which vasopressor strategy is most appropriate now?", "options": ["Add epinephrine infusion targeting higher MAP (70-75 mm Hg)", "Add low-dose dobutamine to improve splanchnic perfusion", "Add angiotensin II infusion while maintaining current MAP target", "Increase vasopressin above 0.04 units/min to exploit V1 receptor effect", "Switch norepinephrine to phenylephrine to minimize beta-adrenergic effects"], "answer": "C", "answer_index": 2, "explanation": "He has vasodilatory shock in advanced cirrhosis with catecholamine-resistant hypotension despite adequate volume; angiotensin II is reasonable as a third-line agent in catecholamine-refractory vasodilatory shock and has emerging use in hepatorenal-type circulatory failure. Epinephrine would increase lactate and myocardial oxygen demand without addressing RAAS dysregulation; high-dose vasopressin increases ischemia risk, phenylephrine may worsen gut perfusion, and dobutamine is not indicated with hyperdynamic LV and adequate ScvO2.", "generator_model": "gpt-5.1-2025-11-13", "seed": 125, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "pred": "C", "model_outputs": "Let me analyze this case systematically.\n\nPatient Profile:\n- Decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis (MELD-Na 29)\n- Acute variceal hemorrhage with hemorrhagic shock\n- On norepinephrine 0.24 mcg/kg/min + vasopressin 0.03 units/min\n- MAP 62 mmHg (suboptimal)\n- Lactate 5.1 mmol/L (elevated, indicating tissue hypoperfusion)\n- pH 7.28 (acidotic)\n- ScvO2 76% (normal/high - suggests distributive component)\n- Echo: hyperdynamic LV, small underfilled LV, collapsible IVC\n- CVP 4 mmHg (low)\n\nKey Pathophysiology:\nThis patient has cirrhosis with characteristic vasodilatory physiology (splanchnic vasodilation, low SVR) combined with hemorrhagic shock. The echo findings suggest hypovolemia (underfilled LV, collapsible IVC), but he's also showing signs of distributive shock typical of cirrhosis.\n\nAnalyzing Options:\n\nA. Add epinephrine targeting MAP 70-75: Epinephrine would add more catecholamine load. In cirrhosis, there's often catecholamine resistance. Higher MAP targets haven't shown benefit and may increase cardiac stress.\n\nB. Add dobutamine: With ScvO2 of 76% and hyperdynamic LV function, cardiac output is not the problem. Dobutamine would be inappropriate and could worsen vasodilation.\n\nC. Add angiotensin II: Angiotensin II works through a non-catecholamine pathway (AT1 receptors). In cirrhotic patients with high-output vasodilatory shock, there's often downregulation of catecholamine receptors but preserved response to angiotensin II. The ATHOS-3 trial showed benefit in vasodilatory shock refractory to catecholamines. This addresses the catecholamine-resistant vasodilation seen in cirrhosis.\n\nD. Increase vasopressin >0.04 units/min: Doses above 0.04 units/min are associated with increased ischemic complications (mesenteric, digital, cardiac) without proven benefit. This is generally not recommended.\n\nE. Switch to phenylephrine: Pure alpha-agonist would lose the beta-1 effects of norepinephrine. In hemorrhagic shock with ongoing resuscitation needs, this could compromise cardiac output. Also doesn't address the underlying catecholamine resistance.\n\nBest Answer:\nAngiotensin II is the most appropriate third-line agent here. It works through a different receptor pathway, is particularly useful in vasodilatory shock with catecholamine resistance (common in cirrhosis), and has evidence supporting its use in refractory shock.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed125", "question_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed125-002", "question": "A 63-year-old woman with a history of JAK2-positive polycythemia vera treated with hydroxyurea for 9 years presents with 3 months of progressive fatigue, 7-kg weight loss, early satiety, and drenching night sweats.

The echo findings are classic for acute PE with right heart strain.\n\nKey Considerations for Management:\n\n1.

IV alteplase contraindication: The patient has therapeutic anticoagulation with rivaroxaban. Anti-factor Xa level of 170 ng/mL indicates significant anticoagulant effect. IV alteplase is generally contraindicated when anti-factor Xa levels are >30 ng/mL or when DOAC was taken within 48 hours with normal renal function, due to increased bleeding risk.\n\n2. Option A (IV alteplase + thrombectomy): Contraindicated due to therapeutic rivaroxaban levels.\n\n3. Option B (Andexanet alfa → IV alteplase): While andexanet alfa reverses rivaroxaban, using it to enable thrombolysis is not standard practice. This approach lacks evidence and introduces delays. The reversal agents are typically reserved for life-threatening bleeding, not to enable thrombolysis.\n\n4. Option C (Direct to mechanical thrombectomy): This is the preferred approach. Mechanical thrombectomy is effective for large vessel occlusions and is not contraindicated by anticoagulation. Multiple trials support thrombectomy for M1 occlusions. This avoids the bleeding risk of thrombolytics while providing definitive reperfusion.\n\n5. Option D (4-factor PCC → IV alteplase): 4-factor PCC has limited efficacy against direct Xa inhibitors, and this approach to enable thrombolysis is not evidence-based.\n\n6. Option E (No reperfusion): This would be inappropriate given the treatable large vessel occlusion and available interventional capability.\n\nBest answer: Proceed directly to mechanical thrombectomy. This provides effective reperfusion for the M1 occlusion without the bleeding risks associated with thrombolytics in an anticoagulated patient.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed125", "question_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed125-009", "question": "A 22-year-old man with sickle cell disease (HbSS) presents with high fever, cough, and pleuritic chest pain.

Increase simple transfusions to Hgb 12 g/dL\n- This is dangerous. The Hgb is already 10.3 g/dL. Further simple transfusion would increase blood viscosity without reducing HbS percentage significantly, potentially worsening sickling and ACS.\n\nB. Exchange transfusion targeting HbS <30%\n- This is the standard of care for severe/worsening ACS. Exchange transfusion reduces HbS percentage while maintaining appropriate Hgb levels, avoiding hyperviscosity. Guidelines recommend exchange transfusion for ACS that is severe or not responding to simple transfusion.\n\nC. High-dose corticosteroids\n- While corticosteroids have been studied in ACS, they are associated with rebound pain crises and are not standard first-line therapy for severe ACS. The evidence is mixed and they could potentially cause harm.\n\nD. Therapeutic anticoagulation for presumed PE\n- There's no specific indication for PE here. The presentation is consistent with progressive ACS. Empiric anticoagulation without evidence of PE is not indicated.\n\nE. Intubate and defer transfusion changes\n- The patient is not yet in respiratory failure requiring immediate intubation (SpO2 90% on 8L). More importantly, deferring exchange transfusion would miss the opportunity to address the underlying pathophysiology. Exchange transfusion should not be delayed.\n\nThe patient has severe, progressive ACS despite simple transfusion. The Hgb is now adequate (10.3 g/dL), but the HbS percentage remains high. Exchange transfusion is indicated to rapidly reduce HbS to <30% while avoiding hyperviscosity.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed125", "question_id": "20251129T045001943Z_gpt-5.1-2025-11-13_seed125-010", "question": "A 58-year-old man with alcohol-related cirrhosis and portal hypertension is admitted with confusion and generalized tonic-clonic seizures.

The \"seizures\" are likely related to metabolic encephalopathy.\n\nWhy valproic acid is problematic here:\n\n1. Protein binding issue: In cirrhosis, hypoalbuminemia leads to decreased protein binding of valproate. Total levels appear therapeutic, but FREE (active) levels are supratherapeutic, causing toxicity.\n\n2. Valproate-induced hyperammonemia: Valproate inhibits carnitine-mediated transport of fatty acids into mitochondria and can cause hyperammonemia independent of liver disease. This is worsened by:\n   - Pre-existing liver disease\n   - Low carnitine levels (valproate depletes carnitine)\n\n3. Carnitine deficiency: Valproate causes carnitine depletion, which impairs ammonia metabolism and can worsen encephalopathy.\n\nEvaluating options:\n\n- A: Lowering dose might help, but doesn't address the fundamental problem of valproate worsening hyperammonemia in a cirrhotic patient\n- B: Discontinuing valproate removes the drug contributing to hyperammonemia; levetiracetam is liver-safe (renally excreted); L-carnitine supplementation addresses the deficiency and helps with ammonia metabolism\n- C: Phenytoin is highly protein-bound and hepatically metabolized - poor choice in cirrhosis\n- D: Adding another drug doesn't address the underlying problem\n- E: Continuing valproate perpetuates the problem\n\nBest Answer: Option B addresses all issues - removes the offending agent (valproate), provides a safer alternative (levetiracetam), and treats carnitine deficiency.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}]
