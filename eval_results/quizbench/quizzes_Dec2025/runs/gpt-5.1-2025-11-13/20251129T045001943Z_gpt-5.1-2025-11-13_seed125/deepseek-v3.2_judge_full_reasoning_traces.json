The stem describes a child with acute flaccid symmetric weakness, areflexia, normal sensation, and CSF albuminocytologic dissociation, classic for Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). The electrophysiology shows reduced CMAP amplitudes with preserved velocities and normal sensory studies, which is most consistent with a primary axonal motor process. However, the absence of F-waves is a demyelinating feature, not typical for pure AMAN, which usually has preserved or only mildly abnormal F-waves. This creates a mixed picture. The keyed answer is AMAN (B), but the absent F-waves make Acute Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP, A) also highly defensible, as AIDP can present with low CMAPs early on and absent F-waves are a hallmark. This is a case of M (multiple defensible) leading to K (miskeyed). The main logical issue is the electrophysiologic description is ambiguous between early AIDP and AMAN.

Key stem clues: symptomatic pneumonitis (dyspnea, cough, O2 90% on RA, CT findings) without severe hypoxia or life-threatening features. This aligns with Grade 2 per CTCAE (symptomatic, medical intervention indicated, not interfering with ADL). The keyed answer (C) correctly identifies Grade 2 and holds pembrolizumab, but the steroid dose of 1-2 mg/kg/day is the guideline-recommended starting dose for Grade 2. However, option B also states Grade 2, holds pembrolizumab, and starts prednisone 0.5 mg/kg/day.

This constellation is classic for valproate-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy (VHE) in liver disease. The keyed answer (B) correctly addresses all components: discontinuing the offending hepatically metabolized drug (valproate), switching to a renally excreted agent (levetiracetam), and providing carnitine replacement. Alternatives are inferior: continuing valproate (A, D, E) fails to remove the cause; phenytoin (C) is also hepatically metabolized and highly protein-bound, making it risky in this hypoalbuminemic, coagulopathic patient.
