He admits to taking 'massive doses' of an over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medication to manage withdrawal symptoms. ECG shows sinus bradycardia at 45 bpm, a QTc interval of 680 ms, and intermittent broad-complex beats. He is hemodynamically stable but lethargic. Magnesium sulfate 2g IV is administered without change in the rhythm. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?", "options": ["Option A: IV Amiodarone infusion", "Option B: IV Isoproterenol infusion", "Option C: IV Physostigmine", "Option D: Synchronized cardioversion", "Option E: IV Calcium gluconate"], "answer": "B", "answer_index": 1, "explanation": "The patient has loperamide toxicity, which blocks cardiac sodium and potassium channels, causing QTc prolongation and wide-complex dysrhythmias. Unlike congenital Long QT (where isoproterenol is contraindicated), loperamide-induced TdP/QT prolongation is bradycardia-dependent; increasing the heart rate (chemical or electrical overdrive pacing) shortens the QT interval and prevents Torsades de Pointes. Amiodarone prolongs QT and is contraindicated.", "generator_model": "gemini-3-pro-preview", "seed": 127, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "pred": "B", "model_outputs": "The answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T125426901Z_gemini-3-pro-preview_seed127", "question_id": "20251129T125426901Z_gemini-3-pro-preview_seed127-002", "question": "A 4-month-old female presents with failure to thrive, hypotonia, and a history of pyridoxine-responsive seizures. Laboratory evaluation reveals hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and a suppressed parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. Skeletal survey demonstrates diffuse demineralization and 'moth-eaten' radiolucencies at the metaphyses. Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is 15 IU/L (Reference: 150-420 IU/L). Which of the following is the definitive treatment for this condition?", "options": ["Option A: High-dose Vitamin D supplementation", "Option B: Recombinant human parathyroid hormone (Teriparatide)", "Option C: Asfotase alfa", "Option D: Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) monotherapy", "Option E: Bisphosphonate therapy"], "answer": "C", "answer_index": 2, "explanation": "The diagnosis is Hypophosphatasia (HPP), caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the ALPL gene encoding tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP). Low ALP leads to accumulation of inorganic pyrophosphate (an inhibitor of bone mineralization) and pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (causing B6-dependent seizures due to lack of dephosphorylation).

This occurs in the setting of glutathione depletion (malnutrition, acetaminophen use), which disrupts the gamma-glutamyl cycle. N-acetylcysteine replenishes glutathione stores, restoring the feedback loop and halting 5-oxoproline production.
