Unlike congenital Long QT (where isoproterenol is contraindicated), loperamide-induced TdP/QT prolongation is bradycardia-dependent; increasing the heart rate (chemical or electrical overdrive pacing) shortens the QT interval and prevents Torsades de Pointes.

In drug-induced QT prolongation with bradycardia, increasing the heart rate shortens the QT interval and suppresses pause-dependent TdP. This is a standard treatment for acquired long QT syndrome with bradycardia when magnesium fails.\n\n- Option C (Physostigmine): Used for anticholinergic toxicity, not indicated here\n\n- Option D (Synchronized cardioversion): Used for unstable tachyarrhythmias; patient is bradycardic and hemodynamically stable\n\n- Option E (Calcium gluconate): Used for hyperkalemia or calcium channel blocker toxicity; not the primary treatment here\n\nRationale for Best Answer:\nWith severe QT prolongation (680 ms), bradycardia, and ventricular ectopy that didn't respond to magnesium, the next step is to increase the heart rate to shorten the QT interval and prevent TdP.

TSH is <0.01 mIU/L and Free T4 is elevated. He has no neck pain. Thyroid ultrasound with color flow Doppler reveals an absence of vascularity within the thyroid parenchyma. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial treatment?", "options": ["Option A: Methimazole", "Option B: Propylthiouracil", "Option C: Prednisone", "Option D: Radioactive Iodine ablation", "Option E: Potassium Perchlorate"], "answer": "C", "answer_index": 2, "explanation": "This is Type 2 Amiodarone-Induced Thyrotoxicosis (AIT), which is a destructive thyroiditis caused by direct cytotoxic effects of the drug. The key differentiator from Type 1 AIT (Jod-Basedow/iodine-induced synthesis) is the Doppler flow: Type 1 has increased vascularity, while Type 2 has absent vascularity. Type 2 is treated with high-dose glucocorticoids. Thionamides (Methimazole) are ineffective for destructive thyroiditis.", "generator_model": "gemini-3-pro-preview", "seed": 127, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "pred": "C", "model_outputs": "Let me analyze this case systematically.\n\nThe patient has:\n- Chronic amiodarone therapy\n- Hyperthyroidism symptoms (weight loss, palpitations)\n- TSH <0.01 mIU/L with elevated Free T4\n- No neck pain\n- Absent vascularity on thyroid ultrasound with Doppler\n\nThis presentation is consistent with Amiodarone-Induced Thyrotoxicosis (AIT). There are two types:\n\nType 1 AIT: Occurs in patients with underlying thyroid disease (Graves' or nodular goiter). The iodine load from amiodarone causes excess thyroid hormone synthesis. Ultrasound shows INCREASED vascularity.\n\nType 2 AIT: A destructive thyroiditis caused by amiodarone's direct toxic effect on thyroid follicular cells, leading to release of preformed thyroid hormone. Ultrasound shows DECREASED or ABSENT vascularity.\n\nThis patient has Type 2 AIT based on:\n- Absent vascularity on Doppler ultrasound\n- No neck pain (though pain can occur in some cases)\n\nTreatment approaches:\n- Type 1 AIT: Thionamides (methimazole or PTU) ± potassium perchlorate\n- Type 2 AIT: Glucocorticoids (prednisone) - this is the treatment of choice as it addresses the inflammatory/destructive process\n\nRadioactive iodine is not effective in amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis because the high iodine content from amiodarone saturates the thyroid and prevents RAI uptake.\n\nMethimazole and PTU work by blocking thyroid hormone synthesis, but in Type 2 AIT, the problem is release of preformed hormone from destruction, not excess synthesis.\n\nPrednisone (glucocorticoids) is the appropriate treatment for Type 2 AIT as it reduces the inflammatory destruction and inhibits peripheral conversion of T4 to T3.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}]
