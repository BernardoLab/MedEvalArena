Echocardiography reveals a granular 'sparkling' appearance of the myocardium and increased wall thickness. A technetium-99m pyrophosphate (PYP) scan shows Grade 3 cardiac uptake (uptake > rib uptake). Serum immunofixation reveals a small IgG lambda monoclonal protein, and serum free light chain ratio is 1.8.

AL amyloidosis can occasionally show uptake on PYP scans. Therefore, in a patient with a positive PYP scan AND a monoclonal protein, a tissue biopsy (endomyocardial is gold standard if non-cardiac biopsy is negative or to avoid sampling error) is mandatory to distinguish ATTR from AL amyloidosis before starting treatment.", "generator_model": "gemini-3-pro-preview", "seed": 124, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "pred": "C", "model_outputs": " The answer is (C) "}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T125426901Z_gemini-3-pro-preview_seed124", "question_id": "20251129T125426901Z_gemini-3-pro-preview_seed124-002", "question": "A 24-year-old male presents with recurrent fevers, livedo racemosa, and acute left hemiparesis.
