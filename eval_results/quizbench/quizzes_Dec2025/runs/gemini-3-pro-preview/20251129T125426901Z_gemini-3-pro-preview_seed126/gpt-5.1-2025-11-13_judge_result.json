In MGRS-associated C3G, current consensus favors clone-directed therapy (e.g., bortezomib-based) to eliminate the pathogenic monoclonal immunoglobulin driving complement dysregulation and thereby preserve renal function.\nAlternative choices: Eculizumab (A) may have a role in some C3G but is not standard first-line when a treatable clone is present. Mycophenolate (B) and high-dose steroids alone (D) are nonspecific immunosuppression and less effective for MGRS-driven disease. Plasma exchange (E) is not standard chronic therapy for MGRS-C3G.\nMain medical issues: The item’s pathophysiology and management approach are aligned with modern MGRS guidelines; nuance about evolving complement inhibitors is not critical here.\nMinimal fix: Explicitly label the paraprotein as small B-cell or plasma cell clone (e.g., “bone marrow shows 8% kappa-restricted plasma cells”) to make the MGRS diagnosis more explicit.", "medical_accuracy_score": 5, "logical_validity": true, "logical_false_reason": "T", "verdict": "PASS", "fail_reason": "NA"}, "judge_verdict": "PASS", "judge_fail_reason": "NA", "judge_medical_accuracy_score": 5}, {"quiz_id": "20251129T125426901Z_gemini-3-pro-preview_seed126", "question_id": "20251129T125426901Z_gemini-3-pro-preview_seed126-008", "question": "A patient with severe ARDS is ventilated in Assist-Control Volume Control mode.
