It works by directly inhibiting RyR2 channels, reducing calcium leak from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This is supported by guidelines and clinical evidence.\n\nC.

Transvenous pacing often fails to capture or improve cardiac output in severe CCB poisoning due to global myocardial depression.", "generator_model": "gemini-3-pro-preview", "seed": 123, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "pred": "A", "model_outputs": "In this case, we have a patient with severe calcium channel blocker (CCB) toxicity from sustained-release Verapamil overdose presenting with refractory hypotension and bradycardia despite initial standard treatments (fluids, calcium, and glucagon).\n\nLet me analyze each option:\n\nA. High-dose Insulin Euglycemia (HIE) therapy - This is now considered first-line treatment for severe CCB toxicity. It works by improving myocardial carbohydrate metabolism and has inotropic effects independent of calcium channels. It improves cardiac contractility and vascular tone.\n\nB. Transvenous Pacing - While this can address bradycardia, it doesn't address the underlying vasodilation and negative inotropy. Pacing often fails to capture or improve hemodynamics in CCB toxicity because the myocardium cannot respond adequately.\n\nC. Hemodialysis - Verapamil is highly protein-bound and has a large volume of distribution, making hemodialysis ineffective for removal.\n\nD. IV Amiodarone - This would worsen the situation as it has calcium channel blocking properties and would further depress cardiac function.\n\nE. IV Lipid Emulsion (20%) - This is used for local anesthetic toxicity and some lipophilic drug overdoses. While verapamil is lipophilic, lipid emulsion is typically considered after HIE therapy has been tried, and evidence for its use in CCB toxicity is less robust than for HIE.\n\nGiven that the patient has already received calcium and glucagon without improvement, the next best step according to current toxicology guidelines is High-dose Insulin Euglycemia therapy. HIE has become the cornerstone of treatment for severe CCB toxicity refractory to initial measures, with evidence showing improved hemodynamics and survival.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}]
