The item correctly identifies LMNA cardiomyopathy as a high-risk channelopathy where ICD is indicated for primary prevention despite LVEF >35% due to non-ischemic etiology and presence of conduction disease (AV block) plus syncope. Alternatives: A (pacemaker) insufficient for arrhythmic risk; C (loop recorder) delays needed therapy; D (amiodarone) not first-line for primary prevention; E (beta-blocker/reassessment) ignores high-risk genetics and syncope. Medical accuracy: aligns with 2022 AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines for LMNA. Minimal fix: none needed; item is clear and accurate.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"T\",\n    \"logical_validity\": true,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n    \t\n

Key stem clues: brief, frequent, unilateral faciobrachial dystonic seizures with preserved consciousness, normal EEG/MRI, and emerging memory impairment are highly specific for anti-LGI1 autoimmune encephalitis. The most appropriate initial treatment for this condition is prompt immunotherapy. While intravenous methylprednisolone (C) is a correct component of immunotherapy, the standard initial treatment for suspected autoimmune encephalitis is high-dose intravenous corticosteroids (e.g., methylprednisolone) often combined with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or plasma exchange. However, among the options, levetiracetam (A) is a reasonable and common initial symptomatic treatment for seizures while diagnostic workup proceeds, and it is not contraindicated. The key (C) is defensible but not uniquely so, as starting an antiseizure medication like levetiracetam concurrently is also appropriate. The main logical issue is miskeying, as the rationale correctly identifies the disease but the keyed answer is not the singular, uncontested best initial step from the provided list. Minimal fix: Change the key to A (Levetiracetam) with a rationale stating it is for initial symptomatic seizure control while arranging urgent immunotherapy, or rephrase the stem to ask for the definitive disease-modifying treatment.\",\n  \"logical_false_reason\": \"K\",\n  \"logical_validity\": false,\n  \"medical_accuracy_score\":  \t\n  \"3\"\n}",

Key stem clues: High anion gap metabolic acidosis (AG=24) with normal lactate, negative ketones, normal osmol gap, and normal renal function in a septic, malnourished patient with chronic acetaminophen use. This pattern rules out toxic alcohols (A, D), D-lactic acidosis (B, typically in short bowel), and salicylates (E, often causes respiratory alkalosis). The logic is sound, pointing to pyroglutamic acidosis (C) due to glutathione depletion from the stated risk factors. Medical accuracy is high, aligning with known associations. No logical issues; a single best answer is defensible. Minimal fix: None required for validity; could explicitly state 'anion gap = 24' for clarity.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"T\",\n    \"logical_validity\": true,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":

Key stem clues: Dapsone-induced methemoglobinemia (MetHb 18%), cyanosis, normal PaO2, pulse oximetry unresponsive to O2, and a history of hemolysis with fava beans (suggesting G6PD deficiency). The logic correctly identifies methylene blue (A) as contraindicated in G6PD deficiency. However, the keyed answer (B, ascorbic acid) is not the most appropriate initial treatment. For symptomatic methemoglobinemia (as indicated by cyanosis, shortness of breath, and 18% MetHb), the standard of care is methylene blue unless contraindicated. In G6PD deficiency with a contraindication to methylene blue, the appropriate initial treatment is exchange transfusion, not ascorbic acid, which acts too slowly for a symptomatic patient. This makes option A the uniquely correct answer based on the stem's logic, but it is contraindicated, leaving no correct option among the choices. The item is therefore miskeyed and also has a secondary issue of no defensible answer (N). Main medical issue: Ascorbic acid is not the appropriate initial treatment for symptomatic methemoglobinemia in this context.
