More importantly, adrenal androgens may be shunted into pathways producing mineralocorticoids.  \nA known but rare cause of mineralocorticoid excess in CAIS is **cortisone reductase deficiency** (or altered 11β-HSD2 activity) leading to excessive adrenal steroid production, but here the aldosterone is high and renin low, suggesting primary hyperaldosteronism or a condition mimicking it.  \n\nIn CAIS, there is often **increased adrenal secretion of mineralocorticoid precursors** such as DOC or corticosterone due to altered steroidogenesis, but aldosterone itself can be elevated due to altered regulation. However, the question asks for an agent that **specifically targets the underlying mineralocorticoid excess** in this syndrome.  \n\nIn some reported cases, the mineralocorticoid excess in CAIS is due to **increased adrenal androgen precursors acting as mineralocorticoids** and also possibly increased aldosterone from altered adrenal zonation.  \nThe first-line treatment for mineralocorticoid excess is a **mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist** (spironolactone or eplerenone), but spironolactone also acts as an **androgen receptor antagonist** — which is irrelevant in CAIS because the androgen receptor is already nonfunctional due to a null mutation.
