Pathophysiology Mismatch: CAIS (Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome) is not associated with mineralocorticoid excess. The clinical presentation (46,XY female, hypertension, hypokalemia) mimics 17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency (a form of CAH), not CAIS.

If the mechanism were androgen-mediated MR activation (as the explanation claims), the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System would be suppressed due to volume expansion, resulting in low aldosterone.

Pathophysiology Mismatch: CAIS (Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome) is not associated with mineralocorticoid excess. The clinical presentation (46,XY female, hypertension, hypokalemia) mimics 17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency (a form of CAH), not CAIS. In 17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency, the correct treatment would be glucocorticoids (Option D), not Spironolactone.\n2. Lab Value Contradiction: The stem reports elevated aldosterone. If the mechanism were androgen-mediated MR activation (as the explanation claims), the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System would be suppressed due to volume expansion, resulting in low aldosterone.
