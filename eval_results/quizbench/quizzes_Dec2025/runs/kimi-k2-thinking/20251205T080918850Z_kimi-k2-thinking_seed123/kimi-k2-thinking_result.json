Device interrogation reveals normal lead parameters but frequent pacemaker-mediated tachycardia (PMT) episodes terminated by the device's algorithm. However, she continues to report symptoms. Telemetry shows intermittent 2:1 AV block during atrial tracking, with every second P wave falling within post-ventricular atrial refractory period (PVARP).
