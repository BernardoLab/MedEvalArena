When the intrinsic atrial rate rises above this limit, the device suddenly switches from 1:1 tracking to 2:1 block, causing a precipitous drop in ventricular rate (e.g., from 140 bpm to 70 bpm), resulting in cerebral hypoperfusion and symptoms.\n\nThis problematic behavior typically occurs when the Upper Tracking Limit (UTL) is programmed higher than the 2:1 block rate, or when the Wenckebach window is absent. To prevent the sudden 2:1 block, the device's programmed parameters must ensure that the \"Wenckebach behavior\" (gradual lengthening of the AV delay to cap the ventricular rate) engages before the 2:1 block point is reached.\n\nThis can be achieved by:\n1.  Shortening the TARP (Shortening AV delay or PVARP) to increase the 2:1 block rate. (However, shortening PVARP increases the risk of Pacemaker-Mediated Tachycardia (PMT), which is already a problem for this patient).\n2.  Reducing the Upper Tracking Limit (UTL) so that it is lower than the 2:1 block rate. This ensures that as the atrial rate increases, the pacemaker enters the Wenckebach mode at the UTL (e.g., 120 bpm) rather than continuing 1:1 tracking until hitting the \"brick wall\" of the TARP limit (sudden block). Wenckebach behavior smoothes the ventricular rate and prevents the sudden rate halving that causes syncope.\n\nOption A (Extend PVARP) would increase TARP and lower the 2:1 block rate, worsening the symptoms.\nOption B (Dynamic PVARP extension after PVC) is a feature designed to prevent PMT initiation by PVCs but does not address the 2:1 block occurring during sinus tachycardia/atrial tracking.\nOption D (DDI mode) prevents tracking altogether, which fails to preserve AV synchrony.\nOption E (Atrial preference pacing) is used for arrhythmia suppression and does not resolve the upper rate behavior issue.\n\nTherefore, reducing the upper tracking limit is the most effective programming adjustment to prevent sudden rate drops while maintaining synchrony up to a safe heart rate.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251205T080918850Z_kimi-k2-thinking_seed123", "question_id": "20251205T080918850Z_kimi-k2-thinking_seed123-002", "question": "A 42-year-old man with a heterozygous CSF1R p.Arg782His mutation and early-stage adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids (ALSP) has mild cognitive impairment and gait instability.

Diagnosis: The patient has Adult-onset Leukoencephalopathy with Axonal Spheroids and Pigmented glia (ALSP), previously known as Hereditary Diffuse Leukoencephalopathy with Spheroids (HDLS). This disorder is caused by mutations in the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (*CSF1R*) gene. The pathophysiology involves primary microglial dysfunction, as CSF1R is critical for microglial survival and function.\n\n2.  Disease Course: ALSP is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by parkinsonism, cognitive decline, pyramidal signs, and psychiatric symptoms. Without effective treatment, patients typically progress to severe disability and death within a few years of onset.\n\n3.  Evaluate Interventions:\n    *   Immunosuppression (IVIG, Cyclophosphamide): ALSP is often misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis or autoimmune encephalitis. However, because the underlying mechanism is not autoimmune but rather a genetic defect in microglia, therapies like steroids, IVIG (Option A), and cyclophosphamide (Option B) have generally failed to show clinical benefit or halt disease progression.\n    *   Symptomatic Management (Donepezil): Medications like donepezil (Option E) may provide modest, temporary symptomatic benefit for cognitive symptoms but do not modify the disease course or stop neurodegeneration.\n    *   Ruxolitinib: While JAK inhibitors modify immune signaling, they are not an established disease-modifying therapy for ALSP.\n    *   Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT): Microglia are tissue-resident macrophages. Although they originate from the yolk sac, donor-derived cells from bone marrow transplantation can engraft in the brain and differentiate into microglia-like cells. Clinical evidence from case series and retrospective studies indicates that allogeneic HSCT (Option C) can arrest the progression of demyelination and stabilize cognitive and motor function in ALSP patients.\n\n4.  Conclusion: HSCT is currently the only intervention shown to halt the progression of ALSP. It is most effective when performed early in the disease course, prior to the onset of severe disability, as the neurological damage usually cannot be reversed. Given the patient is in the early stage, this is the intervention with the highest disease-modifying efficacy.\n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251205T080918850Z_kimi-k2-thinking_seed123", "question_id": "20251205T080918850Z_kimi-k2-thinking_seed123-003", "question": "A 64-year-old man with metastatic hemangiopericytoma presents with refractory hypoglycemia (glucose 28 mg/dL) despite 20% dextrose infusion at 100 mL/hour.

Refractory hypoglycemia: Glucose 28 mg/dL.\n2.  Suppressed insulin and C-peptide: Indicates the hypoglycemia is not insulin-mediated (rule out insulinoma).\n3.  Elevated IGF-2 and wide IGF-2:IGF-1 ratio: The tumor secretes high-molecular-weight IGF-2 (\"Big IGF-2\"). This molecule activates insulin receptors (causing hypoglycemia) and suppresses Growth Hormone (GH) secretion via negative feedback. The suppression of GH leads to low levels of IGF-1 and IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3). The reduction in IGFBP-3 prevents the formation of ternary complexes that normally sequester IGF-2, leading to high levels of free \"Big IGF-2\" capable of stimulating insulin receptors.\n\nPharmacologic Management:\n*   Glucocorticoids (Option A): High-dose glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone, dexamethasone, or hydrocortisone) are the most effective medical therapy for NICTH. They work by stimulating gluconeogenesis and increasing peripheral insulin resistance (counteracting the insulin-like effect of Big IGF-2). They may also reduce tumor production of IGF-2 in some cases. A continuous infusion of hydrocortisone 10 mg/hour provides a high stress-dose (240 mg/day, roughly equivalent to 60 mg prednisone), which typically restores euglycemia within 24 hours.\n*   Recombinant IGF-1 (Option B): Recombinant IGF-1 has insulin-like activity and causes hypoglycemia as a side effect; it would not correct the hypoglycemia. *Recombinant Growth Hormone (rhGH)* is a treatment option (to stimulation IGFBP-3 production), but not IGF-1 itself.\n*   Diazoxide (Option C): This drug inhibits insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells by opening K-ATP channels. Since insulin is already suppressed in NICTH, diazoxide is ineffective.\n*   Octreotide (Option D): While used for neuroendocrine tumors, octreotide is generally ineffective for NICTH and may worsen hypoglycemia. Octreotide suppresses GH secretion, further lowering IGFBP-3 levels and potentially increasing the concentration of free, active Big IGF-2.\n*   Glucagon (Option E): While glucagon can transiently raise glucose, patients with severe NICTH often have depleted hepatic glycogen stores due to the chronic insulin-like drive. Additionally, the continuous massive stimulation of glucose uptake by the tumor-derived IGF-2 often outstrips the capacity of intermittent glucagon. Glucocorticoids provide a more sustained and mechanistically robust counter-regulatory effect.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251205T080918850Z_kimi-k2-thinking_seed123", "question_id": "20251205T080918850Z_kimi-k2-thinking_seed123-004", "question": "A 59-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate develops progressive dyspnea and weight loss.

The clinical presentation of profuse vomiting and diarrhea corresponds to the initial gastrointestinal phase (0–24 hours). The immediate threat to life in this phase is hypovolemic and cardiogenic shock, followed by multisystem organ failure.\n\nAnalysis of Options:\n*   A. Colchicine-specific Fab fragments 4 g IV bolus: Colchicine-specific Fab fragments are the only specific antidote for colchicine poisoning. They work by binding free colchicine in the plasma, creating a concentration gradient that pulls the drug from the tissues (the \"sink\" effect). The landmark study by Baud et al. (NEJM, 1995) demonstrated that the administration of colchicine-specific Fab fragments reversed severe cardiogenic shock and resulted in survival in a massive ingestion (60 mg) case that was otherwise predicted to be fatal. Although the Baud study used a lower dose (480 mg) due to supply limitations, a stoichiometric calculation for neutralizing a 60 mg body burden suggests a dose in the range of 4–7.5 g (based on Fab:drug molecular weight ratios). Thus, 4 g is a pharmacologically appropriate dose for full neutralization. While this treatment is not commercially available in many regions (often requiring compassionate use authorization or unavailable entirely), it is the only intervention on the list that has been *demonstrated* to mechanistically reverse toxicity and reduce mortality in severe overdose in the literature.\n*   B. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF): G-CSF is frequently used as a supportive measure during the delayed bone marrow suppression phase (days 3–7) to treat leukopenia/agranulocytosis. While some retrospective data suggest improved outcomes, there is no prospective evidence demonstrating that *early* initiation (within 12 hours) reduces mortality from the primary cause of early death (cardiovascular collapse).\n*   C. Continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH): Colchicine has a very large volume of distribution (2–20 L/kg), making extracorporeal removal methods like hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, or hemofiltration ineffective at removing a clinically significant amount of the drug.\n*   D. N-acetylcysteine (NAC): While NAC deals with oxidative stress and is the antidote for acetaminophen, there is no clinical evidence demonstrating mortality reduction in human colchicine poisoning.\n*   E. Plasma exchange: Similar to dialysis, plasma exchange is ineffective due to the large volume of distribution and rapid tissue distribution of colchicine.\n\nTherefore, the administration of colchicine-specific Fab fragments is the best answer based on toxicological principles and historical literature demonstrating efficacy in preventing death.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251205T080918850Z_kimi-k2-thinking_seed123", "question_id": "20251205T080918850Z_kimi-k2-thinking_seed123-006", "question": "A 55-year-old man with severe Barlow's disease undergoes 3D transesophageal echocardiography for mitral valve repair planning.

Pathophysiology & Repair Goals: Barlow's disease is characterized by myxomatous degeneration, annular dilation, and excess leaflet tissue (bileaflet prolapse). The goal of repair is to restore leaflet coaptation and stabilize the annulus.\n2.  Determinants of Durability: A durable mitral valve repair relies heavily on achieving a large surface area of coaptation (often defined as a coaptation length or height of ≥ 8-10 mm).\n3.  Role of the Anterior Leaflet: The anterior leaflet functions as the primary \"curtain\" covering the mitral orifice during systole. The ability to create a sufficient zone of coaptation depends fundamentally on the length (and surface area) of the anterior leaflet.\n4.  Analyzing the Options:\n    *   A. Anterior leaflet length >35 mm: In Barlow's disease, the leaflets are typically elongated and thickened (excess tissue). An anterior leaflet length of >35 mm is significantly larger than normal (approx. 20-25 mm). This excess length provides ample tissue reserve to create a deep and extensive zone of coaptation (e.g., >10 mm vertical overlap) once the posterior leaflet is resected/stabilized and the annulus is resized. While a very long anterior leaflet (>30-35 mm) is a known risk factor for *Systolic Anterior Motion (SAM)* if not managed (e.g., with a large enough ring or sliding plasty), it is paradoxically the anatomical feature that ensures durability (freedom from late recurrence) by guaranteeing a competent seal with a large safety margin of overlap. Conversely, short anterior leaflets (<25 mm) are associated with repair failure in other pathologies.\n    *   B. Posterior leaflet thickness >5 mm: Indicates the severity of myxomatous change but does not directly predict coaptation mechanics or durability.\n    *   C. Annular height to commissural width ratio >0.3: Describes annular saddle shape. While restoring saddle shape is beneficial, a pre-repair ratio of >0.3 is not the standard predictor used for durability planning.\n    *   D. Flail gap distance <10 mm: Describes the severity of the lesion (gap size to be bridged) but is not the best predictor of the final stable coaptation length.\n    *   E. Coaptation depth >15 mm: In functional MR, a large coaptation depth (tethering) predicts failure. In Barlow's, this metric is less standard as a positive predictor.\n\nConclusion: The presence of a long anterior leaflet (excess tissue characteristic of Barlow's) enables the surgeon to construct a repair with a large surface of coaptation, which is the strongest correlate of long-term durability.\n\nThe answer is (A)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251205T080918850Z_kimi-k2-thinking_seed123", "question_id": "20251205T080918850Z_kimi-k2-thinking_seed123-007", "question": "A 67-year-old man presents with 18 months of progressive insomnia, dysautonomia, bulbar dysfunction, and gait instability.

The two main options are spironolactone and eplerenone.\n\nSpironolactone is a non-selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. It also has significant affinity for progesterone and androgen receptors (antagonist) and inhibits steroidogenic enzymes, specifically 17$\\alpha$-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase.\nIn a patient with CAIS, the androgen receptor (AR) is non-functional, so the anti-androgenic receptor blockade by spironolactone is clinically irrelevant regarding demasculinization. However, phenotypic females with CAIS typically have intact intra-abdominal testes that secrete high levels of testosterone. This testosterone is aromatized peripherally to estradiol, which is crucial for the maintenance of female secondary sexual characteristics and bone density in these patients. Spironolactone's inhibition of steroidogenic enzymes (17$\\alpha$-hydroxylase) can impair testosterone production, thereby reducing the substrate available for aromatization to estrogen. This could lead to a hypoestrogenic state (e.g., hot flashes, bone loss), which is detrimental.\n\nEplerenone is a highly selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. It effectively targets the mineralocorticoid excess causing the hypertension and hypokalemia but lacks the anti-androgenic and steroidogenesis-inhibiting side effects of spironolactone.

Key features pointing to this diagnosis include:\n1.  Histology: The \"diffuse capillary proliferation within alveolar septa\" is pathognomonic for PCH.\n2.  Hemodynamics: Severe pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension (mPAP 52 mmHg, PAWP 6 mmHg, PVR 11 WU) distinguishing it from Group 2 (left heart disease).\n3.  Clinical Context: Systemic sclerosis is a known risk factor/associated condition for PVOD/PCH.\n4.  Response to Therapy: The patient has failed to respond to epoprostenol and macitentan. In PCH/PVOD, pulmonary vasodilators (like prostacyclins and endothelin receptor antagonists) are often ineffective and can be detrimental, potentially causing severe pulmonary edema due to increased hydrostatic pressure in the abnormally proliferating leaky capillaries or upstream of venular obstructions.\n\nAnalysis of Options:\n*   A & B (More Vasodilators): Switching to inhaled treprostinil or adding selexipag targets the same pathways as the failed therapies and increases the risk of life-threatening pulmonary edema without addressing the underlying pathology.\n*   C (Immunosuppression): While systemic sclerosis is an autoimmune disease, scleroderma-associated pulmonary vascular disease (PAH and PCH) is generally refractory to immunosuppressive therapy (unlike Lupus-associated PAH). PCH is an angioproliferative disorder, and immunosuppression does not reverse the capillary proliferation.\n*   E (Balloon Pulmonary Angioplasty): BPA is the treatment for Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH, WHO Group 4). This patient does not have thromboembolic disease.\n*   D (Lung Transplantation): Because PCH (and PVOD) is progressive, has a very poor prognosis (worse than typical PAH), and responds poorly to medical therapy, bilateral lung transplantation is the definitive treatment. It is the only intervention associated with significant long-term (5-year) survival for patients with this diagnosis who are symptomatic and non-responsive to or intolerant of medical management.

Transfusion alone (E) is futile without definitive hemorrhage control.", "generator_model": "kimi-k2-thinking", "seed": 123, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "pred": "B", "model_outputs": "The clinical presentation is consistent with an aortobronchial fistula (ABF), a life-threatening complication of chronic aortic dissection or aneurysm, characterized by massive hemoptysis and hemodynamic instability. The immediate goal of management is to secure the airway (often with differential lung ventilation) and stop the hemorrhage.\n\n1.  Selection of Modality (Open vs. Endovascular): Open surgical repair (Option A) in the acute setting of massive hemoptysis and instability is associated with significant operative mortality (historically 15–40% or higher) due to the physiological stress of thoracotomy, aortic cross-clamping, and dissection in a potentially infected/inflammatory field. In contrast, Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair (TEVAR) provides immediate sealing of the fistula with significantly lower perioperative mortality rates and has become the first-line therapy for acute ABF.\n\n2.  Management of the Left Subclavian Artery (LSA): In type B aortic dissections and associated pathologies, achieving a secure proximal seal often requires extending the stent graft into Zone 2, which involves covering the origin of the LSA.\n    *   Option C vs. Option B: Using the SVS (Society for Vascular Surgery) guidelines for the management of the LSA with TEVAR: In *elective* cases, routine revascularization is recommended to reduce the risk of stroke and spinal cord ischemia. However, in the setting of rupture or hemodynamic instability (like this hypotensive patient with massive bleeding), the priority is life-saving hemorrhage control. Performing adjunctive revascularization (carotid-subclavian bypass or transposition) prolongs operative time and adds trauma, which an unstable patient cannot tolerate. Therefore, the LSA should be covered to achieve the seal immediately, and revascularization can be deferred to a later time if neurological symptoms develop or the patient stabilizes (damage control approach).\n\n3.  Other Options: Balloon tamponade of the aorta (Option D) is perilous at the site of a dissection/fistula and is not a standard definitive treatment. Massive transfusion alone (Option E) is palliative as the patient will exsanguinate without repair.\n\nTherefore, TEVAR with LSA coverage maximizes immediate survival probability by rapidly stopping the bleed with the least immediate surgical trauma.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}]
