Device interrogation reveals normal lead parameters but frequent pacemaker-mediated tachycardia (PMT) episodes terminated by the device's algorithm. However, she continues to report symptoms.

Pacemaker-mediated tachycardia (PMT) episodes\n2. Intermittent 2:1 AV block during atrial tracking\n3. Every second P wave falling within PVARP\n\nThe key issue here is that the PVARP is too long relative to the patient's intrinsic atrial rate, causing functional 2:1 block. This happens when the total atrial refractory period (TARP = AV delay + PVARP) is too long, so at higher atrial rates, every other P wave falls in the PVARP and cannot be tracked.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\nA. Extend PVARP by 50 ms - This would worsen the 2:1 block problem by making TARP even longer. This is counterproductive.\n\nB. Enable dynamic PVARP extension after PVCs - This specifically addresses PMT prevention after PVCs by temporarily extending PVARP only when needed (after retrograde conduction risk). This allows shorter baseline PVARP, which would help prevent the 2:1 block issue while still protecting against PMT.\n\nC. Reduce upper tracking limit to 120 bpm - This doesn't address the PVARP issue and would limit the patient's ability to increase heart rate with activity.\n\nD. Switch to DDI mode at rest - DDI mode doesn't track atrial activity, which would eliminate AV synchrony during intrinsic atrial activity. This sacrifices the benefit of atrial tracking.\n\nE. Enable atrial preference pacing - This is used to prevent atrial arrhythmias by overdrive pacing the atrium, not relevant to this problem.\n\nThe best solution is to enable dynamic PVARP extension (option B). This allows a shorter baseline PVARP (preventing 2:1 block during normal atrial tracking) while extending PVARP only after PVCs (when retrograde conduction and PMT risk is highest). This preserves AV synchrony while preventing PMT.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251205T080918850Z_kimi-k2-thinking_seed123", "question_id": "20251205T080918850Z_kimi-k2-thinking_seed123-002", "question": "A 42-year-old man with a heterozygous CSF1R p.Arg782His mutation and early-stage adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids (ALSP) has mild cognitive impairment and gait instability.

Intravenous immunoglobulin monthly - IVIG is used for autoimmune conditions. ALSP is not an autoimmune disease but a genetic microgliopathy. No evidence supports this approach.\n\nB. Oral cyclophosphamide - This immunosuppressant has no established role in ALSP treatment.\n\nC. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) - This is the key intervention. Since ALSP is caused by dysfunctional microglia (which are derived from hematopoietic stem cells), HSCT can replace the defective microglia with donor-derived healthy cells. Multiple case reports and small series have shown that HSCT performed early in the disease course (before severe disability) can stabilize or improve symptoms.

N-acetylcysteine - This is the antidote for acetaminophen poisoning, not colchicine. There's no established role for NAC in colchicine toxicity.\n\nE.

Adjunctive left subclavian revascularization (C) prevents spinal ischemia and reduces perioperative stroke risk compared to coverage alone (B). Open repair (A) carries >80% mortality in this setting. Balloon tamponade (D) is a temporary bridge only. Transfusion alone (E) is futile without definitive hemorrhage control.", "generator_model": "kimi-k2-thinking", "seed": 123, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "pred": "B", "model_outputs": "I need to analyze this case of aortobronchial fistula (ABF) in a patient with chronic type B aortic dissection.\n\nKey clinical features:\n- 62-year-old man with chronic type B dissection (3 years)\n- Massive hemoptysis\n- 7 cm ulcer-like projection with active extravasation into left lower lobe bronchus\n- Hypotensive (85/50 mmHg) - hemodynamically unstable\n\nAnalysis of options:\n\nA. Emergent thoracotomy with open surgical repair\n- Traditional approach but carries very high mortality (40-50%+) in unstable patients\n- Requires cardiopulmonary bypass, single lung ventilation\n- Technically challenging in chronic dissection with adhesions\n- High perioperative mortality in hemodynamically unstable patients\n\nB. TEVAR with left subclavian coverage\n- Endovascular approach is less invasive\n- Can be performed rapidly in unstable patients\n- Left subclavian coverage without revascularization may be acceptable in emergent situations\n- Lower immediate mortality than open repair\n\nC. TEVAR with adjunctive left subclavian artery revascularization\n- Adds time and complexity to the procedure\n- In an emergency with active hemorrhage, the priority is stopping the bleeding\n- Revascularization can be staged if needed\n- Adding revascularization in an unstable patient increases operative time and risk\n\nD. Balloon tamponade of the aortic true lumen\n- Temporizing measure only\n- Does not definitively address the fistula\n- May be used as a bridge but not definitive treatment\n\nE. Massive transfusion protocol only\n- Supportive care without addressing the source\n- Patient will exsanguinate without intervention\n- Essentially palliative\n\nBest answer:\nFor aortobronchial fistula in an unstable patient, TEVAR has emerged as the preferred approach due to lower procedural mortality compared to open repair. In an emergency situation with hemodynamic instability, covering the left subclavian without immediate revascularization is acceptable - the priority is stopping the hemorrhage. Adding subclavian revascularization (option C) would add time and complexity that could be detrimental in this unstable patient.\n\nThe answer is (B)"}]
