Flecainide has been shown in CPVT to reduce ventricular arrhythmias by directly inhibiting RyR2-mediated calcium release.  \n\nGiven the scenario of a competitive athlete with breakthrough syncope, monotherapy with flecainide alone is not recommended as first-line, and verapamil is not first-line for CPVT. ICD with sotalol is not optimal initial pharmacologic strategy; sotalol is less effective than nadolol in CPVT, and ICD alone without adequate pharmacologic suppression can lead to electrical storm.  \n\nThe most effective long-term pharmacologic strategy to prevent recurrence here is combination therapy with nadolol plus flecainide.  \n\nThe answer is C"}, {"quiz_id": "20251205T080918850Z_kimi-k2-thinking_seed127", "question_id": "20251205T080918850Z_kimi-k2-thinking_seed127-002", "question": "A 72-hour-old term neonate presents with lethargy and poor feeding.
