The question asks for the anticonvulsant *mechanism* most likely to achieve seizure freedom; thus we choose the mechanism corresponding to carbamazepine.\nOption C (sodium channel blockade with carbamazepine) matches current evidence that KCNQ2 gain‑of‑function epilepsies can respond dramatically to carbamazepine, even when phenobarbital/levetiracetam fail. Phenytoin (B) is also a sodium channel blocker but is not the characteristic or preferred agent in this specific genotype; the stem’s key teaching point is the carbamazepine–KCNQ2 association. Clobazam (A), brivaracetam (D), and ketogenic diet (E) have no specific, superior efficacy established in this channelopathy and are less defensible than carbamazepine.\nMain medical accuracy issue: minor oversimplification in explaining “gain‑of‑function causes hyperexcitability,” but overall concept and management implication are sound.\nMinimal fix: Clarify in the explanation that carbamazepine’s preferential benefit has been specifically documented for KCNQ2 encephalopathy, and note that not all sodium channel blockers share equal evidence.\n", "medical_accuracy_score": 4, "logical_validity": true, "logical_false_reason": "T", "verdict": "PASS", "fail_reason": "NA"}, "judge_verdict": "PASS", "judge_fail_reason": "NA", "judge_medical_accuracy_score": 4}, {"quiz_id": "20251205T080918850Z_kimi-k2-thinking_seed127", "question_id": "20251205T080918850Z_kimi-k2-thinking_seed127-008", "question": "A 36-year-old woman with migraine with aura develops acute right hemiparesis (NIHSS 8) and arrives within 90 minutes of symptom onset.
