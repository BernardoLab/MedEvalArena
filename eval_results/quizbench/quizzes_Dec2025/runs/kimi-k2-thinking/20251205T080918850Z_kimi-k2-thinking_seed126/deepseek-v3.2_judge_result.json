Verdict on keyed answer: Correct best. Key stem clues: DRESS syndrome onset 3 weeks after phenytoin, with classic features (fever, eosinophilia, atypical lymphocytosis, transaminitis) and HHV-6 PCR positivity at day 16. This temporal pattern of viral reactivation is a well-established marker of immune dysregulation in DRESS, associated with more severe disease. Main logical issue: None; the stem provides sufficient detail to discriminate. Main medical accuracy issue: None; the association between HHV-6 reactivation and worse prognosis in DRESS is supported by literature. Minimal fix: None required; the item is clear and accurate. Alternative C is uniquely best: A is incorrect as HHV-6 reactivation is common in DRESS from various drugs; B is incorrect as antivirals are not standard; D contradicts the established prognostic significance; E is incorrect as the clinical picture is classic for DRESS, not primary HHV-6 infection.", "medical_accuracy_score": 5, "logical_validity": true, "logical_false_reason": "T", "verdict": "PASS", "fail_reason": "NA"}, "judge_verdict": "PASS", "judge_fail_reason": "NA", "judge_medical_accuracy_score": 5}]
