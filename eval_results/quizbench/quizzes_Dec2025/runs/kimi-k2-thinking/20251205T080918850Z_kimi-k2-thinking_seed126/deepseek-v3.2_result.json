However, in pulmonary edema with low BP, vasodilation could worsen hypotension unless supported.  \n- **Levosimendan** (D) — calcium sensitizer, inodilator, does not increase myocardial oxygen demand as much, some evidence in cardiogenic shock, but not first-line in most US settings.  \n- **Dopamine** (E) at 10 mcg/kg/min — mostly α-effects, increases afterload and heart rate, would be harmful here.  \n\nIn thyroid storm with cardiogenic shock, the main issue is low cardiac output and high afterload (from catecholamines and thyroid hormone). Milrinone reduces afterload and improves contractility without direct chronotropy, and pulmonary edema may improve if afterload is reduced.  \nGiven the options and the inability to use beta-blockers, milrinone is the most appropriate initial inodilator to unload the LV and improve forward flow, though careful monitoring for hypotension is needed.  \n\n**The answer is (C)**  \n\nThe answer is (C)"}, {"quiz_id": "20251205T080918850Z_kimi-k2-thinking_seed126", "question_id": "20251205T080918850Z_kimi-k2-thinking_seed126-004", "question": "A 6-year-old boy presents with recurrent lacunar strokes, livedo racemosa, and systemic vasculitis.
