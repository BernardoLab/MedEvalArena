Etanercept, a TNF-alpha inhibitor, is highly effective and can induce remission. Cyclophosphamide and steroids are less effective. Anakinra has variable response, and rituximab is ineffective as the disease is not B-cell mediated.", "generator_model": "kimi-k2-thinking", "seed": 124, "category": "medicine", "difficulty": "very-hard", "not_for_clinical_use": true, "judge_model": "deepseek-v3.2", "judge_model_outputs_raw": "{\n    \"analysis\": \"Validity label: V. Verdict on keyed answer: Correct best. The stem clearly describes DADA2 (Deficiency of Adenosine Deaminase 2) with classic features (childhood onset, livedo, strokes, low IgM, elevated IgA, negative ANCA, and genetic confirmation). The key discriminating finding is the confirmed genetic diagnosis, which dictates targeted therapy. The keyed answer (C, Etanercept) aligns with established literature where TNF-alpha inhibition is first-line biologic therapy for DADA2, addressing the pathophysiologic TNF-alpha overproduction. Alternatives are less effective: glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide (A, B) are non-specific immunosuppressants; anakinra (D) is not first-line; rituximab (E) is ineffective in this non-B-cell mediated disease. No logical contradictions or missing critical details exist. Medical accuracy is high. Minimal fix: None required; the item is clear and accurate.\",\n    \"logical_false_reason\": \"T\",\n    \"logical_validity\": true,\n    \"medical_accuracy_score\":", "judge_output_valid": false, "judge_parse_error": "json decode error: Expecting value: line 5 column 30 (char 1018)"}]
