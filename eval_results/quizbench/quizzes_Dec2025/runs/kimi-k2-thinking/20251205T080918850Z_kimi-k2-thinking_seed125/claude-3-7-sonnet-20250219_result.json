Hemolysis can interfere with optical clot detection.\n\nB. Anti-Xa chromogenic assay - This measures factor Xa inhibition and is useful for monitoring heparin, LMWH, and factor Xa inhibitors, but not direct thrombin inhibitors like argatroban.\n\nC. Anti-IIa (thrombin) chromogenic assay - This directly measures thrombin inhibition and is specific for direct thrombin inhibitors like argatroban. It's less affected by hemolysis and other interfering factors compared to clot-based assays.\n\nD. ACT - While used for monitoring heparin during procedures, it's less sensitive for argatroban and can be affected by many factors including platelet count and hemolysis.\n\nE. dRVVT - This is primarily used to detect lupus anticoagulant, not for monitoring direct thrombin inhibitors.\n\nGiven the significant hemolysis which can interfere with clot-based assays (aPTT, ACT), the most reliable option would be a chromogenic assay that specifically measures the drug's target.
